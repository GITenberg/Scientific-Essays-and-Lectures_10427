<p>I am not sure that the subject of my address is rightly chosen.&nbsp;
I am not sure that I ought not to have postponed a question of mere
natural history, to speak to you as scientific men, on the questions
of life and death, which have been forced upon us by the awful warning
of an illustrious personage&rsquo;s illness; of preventible disease,
its frightful prevalency; of the 200,000 persons who are said to have
died of fever alone since the Prince Consort&rsquo;s death, ten years
ago; of the remedies; of drainage; of sewage disinfection and utilisation;
and of the assistance which you, as a body of scientific men, can give
to any effort towards saving the lives and health of our fellow-citizens
from those unseen poisons which lurk like wild beasts couched in the
jungle, ready to spring at any moment on the unsuspecting, the innocent,
the helpless.&nbsp; Of all this I longed to speak; but I thought it
best only to hint at it, and leave the question to your common sense
and your humanity; taking for granted that your minds, like the minds
of all right-minded Englishmen, have been of late painfully awakened
to its importance.&nbsp; It seemed to me almost an impertinence to say
more in a city of whose local circumstances I know little or nothing.&nbsp;
As an old sanitary reformer, practical, as well as theoretical, I am
but too well aware of the difficulties which beset any complete scheme
of drainage, especially in an ancient city like this; where men are
paying the penalty of their predecessors&rsquo; ignorance; and dwelling,
whether they choose or not, over fifteen centuries of accumulated dirt.</p>
<p>And, therefore, taking for granted that there is energy and intellect
enough in Winchester to conquer these difficulties in due time, I go
on to ask you to consider, for a time, a subject which is growing more
and more important and interesting, a subject the study of which will
do much towards raising the field naturalist from a mere collector of
specimens&mdash;as he was twenty years ago&mdash;to a philosopher elucidating
some of the grandest problems.&nbsp; I mean the infant science of Bio-geology&mdash;the
science which treats of the distribution of plants and animals over
the globe, and the cause of that distribution.</p>
<p>I doubt not that there are many here who know far more about the
subject than I; who are far better read than I am in the works of Forbes,
Darwin, Wallace, Hooker, Moritz Wagner, and the other illustrious men
who have written on it.&nbsp; But I may, perhaps, give a few hints which
will be of use to the younger members of this Society, and will point
out to them how to get a new relish for the pursuit of field science.</p>
<p>Bio-geology, then, begins with asking every plant or animal you meet,
large or small, not merely&mdash;What is your name?&nbsp; That is the
collector and classifier&rsquo;s duty; and a most necessary duty it
is, and one to be performed with the most conscientious patience and
accuracy, so that a sound foundation may be built for future speculations.&nbsp;
But young naturalists should act not merely as Nature&rsquo;s registrars
and census-takers, but as her policemen and gamekeepers; and ask everything
they meet&mdash;How did you get there?&nbsp; By what road did you come?&nbsp;
What was your last place of abode?&nbsp; And now you are here, how do
you get your living?&nbsp; Are you and your children thriving, like
decent people who can take care of themselves, or growing pauperised
and degraded, and dying out?&nbsp; Not that we have a fear of your becoming
a dangerous class.&nbsp; Madame Nature allows no dangerous classes,
in the modern sense.&nbsp; She has, doubtless for some wise reason,
no mercy for the weak.&nbsp; She rewards each organism according to
its works; and if anything grows too weak or stupid to take care of
itself, she gives it its due deserts by letting it die and disappear.&nbsp;
So, you plant or you animal, are you among the strong, the successful,
the multiplying, the colonising?&nbsp; Or are you among the weak, the
failing, the dwindling, the doomed?</p>
<p>These questions may seem somewhat rude: but you may comfort yourself
by the thought that plants and animals, though they deserve all kindness,
all admiration, deserve no courtesy&mdash;at least in this respect.&nbsp;
For they are, one and all, wherever you find them, vagrants and landlopers,
intruders and conquerors, who have got where they happen to be simply
by the law of the strongest&mdash;generally not without a little robbery
and murder.&nbsp; They have no right save that of possession; the same
by which the puffin turns out the old rabbits, eats the young ones,
and then lays her eggs in the rabbit-burrow&mdash;simply because she
can.</p>
<p>Now, you will see at once that such a course of questioning will
call out a great many curious and interesting answers, if you can only
get the things to tell you their story; as you always may if you will
cross-examine them long enough; and will lead you into many subjects
beside mere botany or entomology.&nbsp; So various, indeed, are the
subjects which you will thus start, that I can only hint at them now
in the most cursory fashion.</p>
<p>At the outset you will soon find yourself involved in chemical and
meteorological questions; as, for instance, when you ask&mdash;How is
it that I find one flora on the sea-shore, another on the sandstone,
another on the chalk, and another on the peat-making gravelly strata?&nbsp;
The usual answer would be, I presume&mdash;if we could work it out by
twenty years&rsquo; experiment, such as Mr. Lawes, of Rothampsted, has
been making on the growth of grasses and leguminous plants in different
soils and under different manures&mdash;the usual answer, I say, would
be&mdash;Because we plants want such and such mineral constituents in
our woody fibre; again, because we want a certain amount of moisture
at a certain period of the year: or, perhaps, simply because the mechanical
arrangement of the particles of a certain soil happens to suit the shape
of our roots and of their stomata.&nbsp; Sometimes you will get an answer
quickly enough; sometimes not.&nbsp; If you ask, for instance, <i>Asplenium
viride</i> how it contrives to grow plentifully in the Craven of Yorkshire
down to 600 or 800 feet above the sea, while in Snowdon it dislikes
growing lower than 2000 feet, and is not plentiful even there?&mdash;it
will reply&mdash;Because in the Craven I can get as much carbonic acid
as I want from the decomposing limestone; while on the Snowdon Silurian
I get very little; and I have to make it up by clinging to the mountain
tops, for the sake of the greater rainfall.&nbsp; But if you ask <i>Polypodium
calcareum</i>&mdash;How is it you choose only to grow on limestone,
while <i>Polypodium Dryopteris</i>, of which, I suspect, you are only
a variety, is ready to grow anywhere?&mdash;<i>Polypodium calcareum</i>
will refuse, as yet, to answer a word.</p>
<p>Again&mdash;I can only give you the merest string of hints&mdash;you
will find in your questionings that many plants and animals have no
reason at all to show why they should be in one place and not in another,
save the very sound reason for the latter which was suggested to me
once by a great naturalist.&nbsp; I was asking&mdash;Why don&rsquo;t
I find such and such a species in my parish, while it is plentiful a
few miles off in exactly the same soil?&mdash;and he answered&mdash;For
the same reason that you are not in America.&nbsp; Because you have
not got there.&nbsp; Which answer threw to me a flood of light on this
whole science.&nbsp; Things are often where they are, simply because
they happen to have got there, and not elsewhere.&nbsp; But they must
have got there by some means, and those means I want young naturalists
to discover; at least, to guess at.</p>
<p>A species, for instance&mdash;and I suspect it is a common case with
insects&mdash;may abound in a single spot, simply because, long years
ago, a single brood of eggs happened to hatch at a time when eggs of
other species, who would have competed against them for food, did not
hatch; and they may remain confined to that spot, though there is plenty
of food for them outside it, simply because they do not increase fast
enough to require to spread out in search of more food.&nbsp; Thus I
should explain a case which I heard of lately of <i>Anthocera trifolii</i>,
abundant for years in one corner of a certain field, and only there;
while there was just as much trefoil all round for its larv&aelig; as
there was in the selected spot.&nbsp; I can, I say, only give hints:
but they will suffice, I hope, to show the path of thought into which
I want young naturalists to turn their minds.</p>
<p>Or, again, you will have to inquire whether the species has not been
prevented from spreading by some natural barrier.&nbsp; Mr. Wallace,
whom you all of course know, has shown in his &ldquo;Malay Archipelago&rdquo;
that a strait of deep sea can act as such a barrier between species.&nbsp;
Moritz Wagner has shown that, in the case of insects, a moderately-broad
river may divide two closely-allied species of beetles, or a very narrow
snow-range, two closely-allied species of moths.</p>
<p>Again, another cause, and a most common one, is: that the plants
cannot spread because they find the ground beyond them already occupied
by other plants, who will not tolerate a fresh mouth, having only just
enough to feed themselves.&nbsp; Take the case of <i>Saxifraga hypnoides</i>
and <i>S. umbrosa</i>, &ldquo;London pride.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are two
especially strong species.&nbsp; They show that, <i>S. hypnoides</i>
especially, by their power of sporting, of diverging into varieties;
they show it equally by their power of thriving anywhere, if they can
only get there.&nbsp; They will grow both in my sandy garden, under
a rainfall of only 23 inches, more luxuriantly than in their native
mountains under a rainfall of 50 or 60 inches.&nbsp; Then how is it
that <i>S. hypnoides</i> cannot get down off the mountains; and that
<i>S. umbrosa</i>, though in Kerry it has got off the mountains and
down to the sea-level, exterminating, I suspect, many species in its
progress, yet cannot get across County Cork?&nbsp; The only answer is,
I believe, that both species are continually trying to go ahead; but
that the other plants already in front of them are too strong for them,
and massacre their infants as soon as born.</p>
<p>And this brings us to another curious question: the sudden and abundant
appearance of plants, like the foxglove and <i>Epilobium angustifolium</i>,
in spots where they have never been seen before.&nbsp; Are there seeds,
as some think, dormant in the ground; or are the seeds which have germinated,
fresh ones wafted thither by wind or otherwise, and only able to germinate
in that one spot because there the soil is clear?&nbsp; General Monro,
now famous for his unequalled memoir on the bamboos, holds to the latter
theory.&nbsp; He pointed out to me that the <i>Epilobium</i> seeds,
being feathered could travel with the wind; that the plant always made
its appearance first on new banks, landslips, clearings, where it had
nothing to compete against; and that the foxglove did the same.&nbsp;
True, and most painfully true, in the case of thistles and groundsels:
but foxglove seeds, though minute, would hardly be carried by the wind
any more than those of the white clover, which comes up so abundantly
in drained fens.&nbsp; Adhuc sub judice lis est, and I wish some young
naturalists would work carefully at the solution; by experiment, which
is the most sure way to find out anything.</p>
<p>But in researches in this direction they will find puzzles enough.&nbsp;
I will give them one which I shall be most thankful to hear they have
solved within the next seven years&mdash;How is it that we find certain
plants, namely, the thrift and the scurvy grass, abundant on the sea-shore
and common on certain mountain-tops, but nowhere between the two?&nbsp;
Answer me that.&nbsp; For I have looked at the fact for years&mdash;before,
behind, sideways, upside down, and inside out&mdash;and I cannot understand
it.</p>
<p>But all these questions, and especially, I suspect, that last one,
ought to lead the young student up to the great and complex question&mdash;How
were these islands re-peopled with plants and animals, after the long
and wholesale catastrophe of the glacial epoch?</p>
<p>I presume you all know, and will agree, that the whole of these islands,
north of the Thames, save certain ice-clad mountain-tops, were buried
for long ages under an icy sea.&nbsp; From whence did vegetable and
animal life crawl back to the land, as it rose again; and cover its
mantle of glacial drift with fresh life and verdure?</p>
<p>Now let me give you a few prolegomena on this matter.&nbsp; You must
study the plants of course, species by species.&nbsp; Take Watson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Cybele Britannica&rdquo; and Moore&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cybele Hibernica;&rdquo;
and let&mdash;as Mr. Matthew Arnold would say&mdash;&ldquo;your thought
play freely about them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Look carefully, too, in the case
of each species, at the note on its distribution, which you will find
appended in Bentham&rsquo;s &ldquo;Handbook,&rdquo; and in Hooker&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Student&rsquo;s Flora.&rdquo;&nbsp; Get all the help you can,
if you wish to work the subject out, from foreign botanists, both European
and American; and I think that, on the whole, you will come to some
such theory as this for a general starling platform.&nbsp; We do not
owe our flora&mdash;I must keep to the flora just now&mdash;to so many
different regions, or types, as Mr. Watson conceives, but to three,
namely, an European or Germanic flora, from the south-east; an Atlantic
flora, from the south-east; a Northern flora, from the north.&nbsp;
These three invaded us after the glacial epoch; and our general flora
is their result.</p>
<p>But this will cause you much trouble.&nbsp; Before you go a step
farther you will have to eliminate from all your calculations most of
the plants which Watson calls glareal, <i>i.e</i>. found in cultivated
ground about habitations.&nbsp; And what their limit may be I think
we never shall know.&nbsp; But of this we may be sure; that just as
invading armies always bring with them, in forage or otherwise, some
plants from their own country&mdash;just as the Cossacks, in 1815, brought
more than one Russian plant through Germany into France&mdash;just as
you have already a crop of North German plants upon the battle-fields
of France&mdash;thus do conquering races bring new plants.&nbsp; The
Romans, during their 300 or 400 years of occupation and civilisation,
must have brought more species, I believe, than I dare mention.&nbsp;
I suspect them of having brought, not merely the common hedge elm of
the south, not merely the three species of nettle, but all our red poppies,
and a great number of the weeds which are common in our cornfields;
and when we add to them the plants which may have been brought by returning
crusaders and pilgrims; by monks from every part of Europe, by Flemings
or other dealers in foreign wool&mdash;we have to cut a huge cantle
out of our indigenous flora: only, having no records, we hardly know
where and what to cut out; and can only, we elder ones, recommend the
subject to the notice of the younger botanists, that they may work it
out after our work is done.</p>
<p>Of course these plants introduced by man, if they are cut out, must
be cut out of only one of the floras, namely, the European; for they,
probably, came from the south-east, by whatever means they came.</p>
<p>That European flora invaded us, I presume, immediately after the
glacial epoch, at a time when France and England were united, and the
German Ocean a mere network of rivers, which emptied into the deep sea
between Scotland and Scandinavia.&nbsp; And here I must add, that endless
questions of interest will arise to those who will study, not merely
the invasion of that truly European flora, but the invasion of reptiles,
insects, and birds, especially birds of passage, which must have followed
it as soon as the land was sufficiently covered with vegetation to support
life.&nbsp; Whole volumes remain to be written on this subject.&nbsp;
I trust that some of your younger members may live to write one of them.&nbsp;
The way to begin will be; to compare the flora and fauna of this part
of England very carefully with that of the southern and eastern counties;
and then to compare them again with the fauna and flora of France, Belgium,
and Holland.</p>
<p>As for the Atlantic flora, you will have to decide for yourselves
whether you accept or not the theory of a sunken Atlantic continent.&nbsp;
I confess that all objections to that theory, however astounding it
may seem, are outweighed in my mind by a host of facts which I can explain
by no other theory.&nbsp; But you must judge for yourselves; and to
do so you must study carefully the distribution of heaths both in Europe
and at the Cape, and their non-appearance beyond the Ural Mountains,
and in America, save in Labrador, where the common ling, an older and
less specialised form, exists.&nbsp; You must consider, too, the plants
common to the Azores, Portugal, the West of England, Ireland, and the
Western Hebrides.&nbsp; In so doing young naturalists will at least
find proofs of a change in the distribution of land and water, which
will utterly astound them when they face it for the first time.</p>
<p>As for the Northern flora, the question whence it came is puzzling
enough.&nbsp; It seems difficult to conceive how any plants could have
survived when Scotland was an archipelago in the same ice-covered condition
as Greenland is now; and we have no proof that there existed after the
glacial epoch any northern continent from which the plants and animals
could have come back to us.&nbsp; The species of plants and animals
common to Britain, Scandinavia, and North America, must have spread
in pre-glacial times when a continent joining them did exist.</p>
<p>But some light has been thrown on this question by an article, as
charming as it is able, on &ldquo;The Physics of the Arctic Ice,&rdquo;
by Dr. Brown of Campster.&nbsp; You will find it in the &ldquo;Quarterly
Journal of the Geological Society&rdquo; for February, 1870.&nbsp; He
shows there that even in Greenland peaks and crags are left free enough
from ice to support a vegetation of between three hundred or four hundred
species of flowering plants; and, therefore, he well says, we must be
careful to avoid concluding that the plant and animal life on the dreary
shores or mountain-tops of the old glacial Scotland was poor.&nbsp;
The same would hold good of our mountains; and, if so, we may look with
respect, even awe, on the Alpine plants of Wales, Scotland, and the
Lake mountains, as organisms, stunted it may be, and even degraded by
their long battle with the elements, but venerable from their age, historic
from their endurance.&nbsp; Relics of an older temperate world, they
have lived through thousands of centuries of frost and fog, to sun themselves
in a temperate climate once more.&nbsp; I can never pick one of them
without a tinge of shame; and to exterminate one of them is to destroy,
for the mere pleasure of collecting, the last of a family which God
has taken the trouble to preserve for thousands of centuries.</p>
<p>I trust that these hints&mdash;for I can call them nothing more&mdash;will
at least awaken any young naturalist who has hitherto only collected
natural objects, to study the really important and interesting question&mdash;How
did these things get here?</p>
<p>Now hence arise questions which may puzzle the mind of a Hampshire
naturalist.&nbsp; You have in this neighbourhood, as you well know,
two, or rather three, soils, each carrying its peculiar vegetation.&nbsp;
First, you have the clay lying on the chalk, and carrying vast woodlands,
seemingly primeval.&nbsp; Next, you have the chalk, with its peculiar,
delicate, and often fragrant crop of lime-loving plants; and next, you
have the poor sands and clays of the New Forest basin, saturated with
iron, and therefore carrying a moorland or peat-loving vegetation, in
many respects quite different from the others.&nbsp; And this moorland
soil, and this vegetation, with a few singular exceptions, repeats itself,
as I daresay you know, in the north of the county, in the Bagshot basin,
as it is called&mdash;the moors of Aldershot, Hartford Bridge, and Windsor
Forest.</p>
<p>Now what a variety of interesting questions are opened up by these
simple facts.&nbsp; How did these three floras get each to its present
place?&nbsp; Where did each come from?&nbsp; How did it get past or
through the other, till each set of plants, after long internecine competition,
settled itself down in the sheet of land most congenial to it?&nbsp;
And when did each come hither?&nbsp; Which is the oldest?&nbsp; Will
any one tell me whether the healthy floras of the moors, or the thymy
flora of the chalk downs, were the earlier inhabitants of these isles?&nbsp;
To these questions I cannot get any answer; and they cannot be answered
without, first&mdash;a very careful study of the range of each species
of plant on the continent of Europe; and next, without careful study
of those stupendous changes in the shape of this island which have taken
place at a very late geological epoch.&nbsp; The composition of the
flora of our moorlands is as yet to me an utter puzzle.&nbsp; We have
Lycopodiums&mdash;three species&mdash;enormously ancient forms which
have survived the age of ice: but did they crawl downward hither from
the northern mountains or upward hither from the Pyrenees?&nbsp; We
have the beautiful bog asphodel again&mdash;an enormously ancient form;
for it is, strange to say, common to North America and to Northern Europe,
but does not enter Asia&mdash;almost an unique instance.&nbsp; It must,
surely, have come from the north; and points&mdash;as do many species
of plants and animals&mdash;to the time when North Europe and North
America were joined.&nbsp; We have, sparingly, in North Hampshire, though,
strangely, not on the Bagshot moors, the Common or Northern Butterwort
(<i>Pinguicula vulgaris</i>); and also, in the south, the New Forest
part of the county, the delicate little <i>Pinguicula lusitanica</i>,
the only species now found in Devon and Cornwall, marking the New Forest
as the extreme eastern limit of the Atlantic flora.&nbsp; We have again
the heaths, which, as I have just said, are found neither in America
nor in Asia, and must, I believe, have come from some south-western
land long since submerged beneath the sea.&nbsp; But more, we have in
the New Forest two plants which are members of the South Europe, or
properly, the Atlantic flora; which must have come from the south and
south-east; and which are found in no other spots in these islands.&nbsp;
I mean the lovely <i>Gladiolus</i>, which grows abundantly under the
ferns near Lyndhurst, certainly wild, but it does not approach England
elsewhere nearer than the Loire and the Rhine; and next, that delicate
orchid, the <i>Spiranthes &aelig;stivalis</i>, which is known only in
a bog near Lyndhurst and in the Channel Islands, while on the Continent
it extends from Southern Europe all through France.&nbsp; Now, what
do these two plants mark?&nbsp; They give us a point in botany, though
not in time, to determine when the south of England was parted from
the opposite shores of France; and whenever that was, it was just after
the Gladiolus and Spiranthes got hither.&nbsp; Two little colonies of
these lovely flowers arrived just before their retreat was cut off.&nbsp;
They found the country already occupied with other plants; and, not
being reinforced by fresh colonists from the south, have not been able
to spread farther north than Lyndhurst.&nbsp; Thus, in the New Forest,
and, I may say in the Bagshot moors, you find plants which you do not
expect, and do not find plants which you do expect; and you are, or
ought to be, puzzled, and I hope also interested, and stirred up to
find out more.</p>
<p>I spoke just now of the time when England was joined to France, as
bearing on Hampshire botany.&nbsp; It bears no less on Hampshire zoology.&nbsp;
In insects, for instance, the presence of the purple emperor and the
white admiral in our Hampshire woods, as well as the abundance of the
great stag-beetle, point to a time when the two countries were joined,
at least as far west as Hampshire; while the absence of these insects
farther to the westward shows that the countries, if ever joined, were
already parted; and that those insects have not yet had time to spread
westward.&nbsp; The presence of these two butterflies, and partly of
the stag-beetle, along the south-east coast of England as far as the
primeval forests of South Lincolnshire, points, as do a hundred other
facts, to a time when the Straits of Dover either did not exist, or
were the bed of a river running from the west; and when, as I told you
just now, all the rivers which now run into the German Ocean, from the
Humber on the west to the Elbe on the east, discharged themselves into
the sea between Scotland and Norway, after wandering through a vast
lowland, covered with countless herds of mammoth, rhinoceros, gigantic
ox, and other mammals now extinct; while the birds, as far as we know,
the insects, the fresh-water fish, and even, as my friend Mr. Brady
has proved, the <i>Entomostraca</i> of the rivers, were the same in
what is now Holland as in what is now our Eastern counties.&nbsp; I
could dwell long on this matter.&nbsp; I could talk long about how certain
species of <i>Lepidoptera</i>&mdash;moths and butterflies&mdash;like
<i>Papilio Machaon</i> and <i>P. Podalirius</i>, swarm through France,
reach up to the British Channel, and have not crossed it, with the exception
of one colony of <i>Machaon</i> in the Cambridgeshire fens.&nbsp; I
could talk long about a similar phenomenon in the case of our migratory
and singing birds; how many exquisite species&mdash;notably those two
glorious songsters, the Orphean Warbler and Hippolais, which delight
our ears everywhere on the other side of the Channel&mdash;follow our
nightingales, blackcaps, and warblers northward every spring almost
to the Straits of Dover, but dare not cross, simply because they have
been, as it were, created since the gulf was opened, and have never
learnt from their parents how to fly over it.</p>
<p>In the case of fishes, again, I might say much on the curious fact
that the Cyprinid&aelig;, or white fish&mdash;carp, etc.&mdash;and their
natural enemy, the pike, are indigenous, I believe, only to the rivers,
English or continental, on the eastern side of the Straits of Dover;
while the rivers on the western side were originally tenanted, like
our Hampshire streams, as now, almost entirely by trout, their only
Cyprinoid being the minnow&mdash;if it, too, be not an interloper; and
I might ask you to consider the bearing of this curious fact on the
former junction of England and France.</p>
<p>But I have only time to point out to you a few curious facts with
regard to reptiles, which should be specially interesting to a Hampshire
bio-geologist.&nbsp; You know, of course, that in Ireland there are
no reptiles, save the little common lizard, <i>Lacerta agilis</i>, and
a few frogs on the mountain-tops&mdash;how they got there I cannot conceive.&nbsp;
And you will, of course, guess, and rightly, that the reason of the
absence of reptiles is: that Ireland was parted off from England before
the creatures, which certainly spread from southern and warmer climates,
had time to get there.&nbsp; You know, of course, that we have a few
reptiles in England.&nbsp; But you may not be aware that, as soon as
you cross the Channel, you find many more species of reptiles than here,
as well as those which you find here.&nbsp; The magnificent green lizard
which rattles about like a rabbit in a French forest, is never found
here; simply because it had not worked northward till after the Channel
was formed.&nbsp; But there are three reptiles peculiar to this part
of England which should be most interesting to a Hampshire zoologist.&nbsp;
The one is the sand lizard (<i>L. stirpium</i>), found on Bourne-heath,
and, I suspect, in the South Hampshire moors likewise&mdash;a North
European and French species.&nbsp; Another, the <i>Coronella l&aelig;vis</i>,
a harmless French and Austrian snake, which has been found about me,
in North Hants and South Berks, now about fifteen or twenty times.&nbsp;
I have had three specimens from my own parish.&nbsp; I believe it not
to be uncommon; and most probably to be found, by those who will look,
both in the New Forest and Woolmer.&nbsp; The third is the Natterjack,
or running toad (<i>Bufo Rubeta</i>), a most beautifully-spotted animal,
with a yellow stripe down his back, which is common with us at Eversley,
and common also in many moorlands of Hants and Surrey; and, according
to Fleming, on heaths near London, and as far north-east as Lincolnshire;
in which case it will belong to the Germanic fauna.&nbsp; Now, here
again we have cases of animals which have just been able to get hither
before the severance of England and France; and which, not being reinforced
from the rear, have been forced to stop, in small and probably decreasing
colonies, on the spots nearest the coast which were fit for them.</p>
<p>I trust that I have not kept you too long over these details.&nbsp;
What I wish to impress upon you is that Hampshire is a country specially
fitted for the study of important bio-geological questions.</p>
<p>To work them out, you must trace the geology of Hampshire, and indeed,
of East Dorset.&nbsp; You must try to form a conception of how the land
was shaped in miocene times, before that tremendous upheaval which reared
the chalk cliffs at Freshwater upright, lifting the tertiary beds upon
their northern slopes.&nbsp; You must ask&mdash;Was there not land to
the south of the Isle of Wight in those ages, and for ages after; and
what was its extent and shape?&nbsp; You must ask&mdash;When was the
gap between the Isle of Wight and the Isle of Purbeck sawn through,
leaving the Needles as remnants on one side, and Old Harry on the opposite?&nbsp;
And was it sawn asunder merely by the age-long gnawing of the waves?&nbsp;
You must ask&mdash;Where did the great river which ran from the west,
where Poole Harbour is now, and probably through what is now the Solent,
depositing brackish water-beds right and left&mdash;where, I say, did
it run into the sea?&nbsp; Where the Straits of Dover are now?&nbsp;
Or, if not there, where?&nbsp; What, too, is become of the land to the
Westward, composed of ancient metamorphic rocks, out of which it ran,
and deposited on what are now the Haggerstone Moors of Poole, vast beds
of grit?&nbsp; What was the climate on its banks when it washed down
the delicate leaves of broad-leaved trees, akin to our modern English
ones, which are found in the fine mud-sand strata of Bournemouth?&nbsp;
When, finally, did it dwindle down to the brook which now runs through
Wareham town?&nbsp; Was its bed, sea or dry land, or under an ice sheet,
during the long ages of the glacial epoch?&nbsp; And if you say&mdash;Who
is sufficient for these things?&mdash;Who can answer these questions?&nbsp;
I answer&mdash;Who but you, or your pupils after you, if you will but
try?</p>
<p>And if any shall reply&mdash;And what use if I do try?&nbsp; What
use, if I do try?&nbsp; What use if I succeed in answering every question
which you have propounded to-night?&nbsp; Shall I be the happier for
it?&nbsp; Shall I be the wiser?</p>
<p>My friends, whether you will be the happier for it, or for any knowledge
of physical science, or for any other knowledge whatsoever, I cannot
tell: that lies in the decision of a Higher Power than I; and, indeed,
to speak honestly, I do not think that bio-geology or any other branch
of physical science is likely, at first at least, to make you happy.&nbsp;
Neither is the study of your fellow-men.&nbsp; Neither is religion itself.&nbsp;
We were not sent into the world to be happy, but to be right; at least,
poor creatures that we are, as right as we can be; and we must be content
with being right, and not happy.&nbsp; For I fear, or rather I hope,
that most of us are not capable of carrying out Talleyrand&rsquo;s recipe
for perfect happiness on earth&mdash;namely, a hard heart and a good
digestion.&nbsp; Therefore, as our hearts are, happily, not always hard,
and our digestions, unhappily, not always good, we will be content to
be made wise by physical science, even though we be not made happy.</p>
<p>And we shall be made truly wise if we be made content; content, too,
not only with what we can understand, but, content with what we do not
understand&mdash;the habit of mind which theologians call&mdash;and
rightly&mdash;faith in God; the true and solid faith, which comes often
out of sadness, and out of doubt, such as bio-geology may well stir
in us at first sight.&nbsp; For our first feeling will be&mdash;I know
mine was when I began to look into these matters&mdash;one somewhat
of dread and of horror.</p>
<p>Here were all these creatures, animal and vegetable, competing against
each other.&nbsp; And their competition was so earnest and complete,
that it did not mean&mdash;as it does among honest shopkeepers in a
civilised country&mdash;I will make a little more money than you; but&mdash;I
will crush you, enslave you, exterminate you, eat you up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Woe
to the weak,&rdquo; seems to be Nature&rsquo;s watchword.&nbsp; The
Psalmist says: &ldquo;The righteous shall inherit the land.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If you go to a tropical forest, or, indeed, if you observe carefully
a square acre of any English land, cultivated or uncultivated, you will
find that Nature&rsquo;s text at first sight looks a very different
one.&nbsp; She seems to say: Not the righteous, but the strong, shall
inherit the land.&nbsp; Plant, insect, bird, what not&mdash;Find a weaker
plant, insect, bird, than yourself, and kill it, and take possession
of its little vineyard, and no Naboth&rsquo;s curse shall follow you:
but you shall inherit, and thrive therein, you, and your children after
you, if they will be only as strong and as cruel as you are.&nbsp; That
is Nature&rsquo;s law: and is it not at first sight a fearful law?&nbsp;
Internecine competition, ruthless selfishness, so internecine and so
ruthless that, as I have wandered in tropic forests, where this temper
is shown more quickly and fiercely, though not in the least more evilly,
than in our slow and cold temperate one, I have said: Really these trees
and plants are as wicked as so many human beings.</p>
<p>Throughout the great republic of the organic world the motto of the
majority is, and always has been as far back as we can see, what it
is, and always has been, with the majority of human beings: &ldquo;Everyone
for himself, and the devil take the hindmost.&rdquo;&nbsp; Overreaching
tyranny; the temper which fawns, and clings, and plays the parasite
as long as it is down, and when it has risen, fattens on its patron&rsquo;s
blood and life&mdash;these, and the other works of the flesh, are the
works of average plants and animals, as far as they can practise them.&nbsp;
At least, so says at first sight the science of bio-geology; till the
naturalist, if he be also human and humane, is glad to escape from the
confusion and darkness of the universal battle-field of selfishness
into the order and light of Christmas-tide.</p>
<p>For then there comes to him the thought&mdash;And are these all the
facts?&nbsp; And is this all which the facts mean?&nbsp; That mutual
competition is one law of Nature, we see too plainly.&nbsp; But is there
not, besides that law, a law of mutual help?&nbsp; True it is, as the
wise man has said, that the very hyssop on the wall grows there because
all the forces of the universe could not prevent its growing.&nbsp;
All honour to the hyssop.&nbsp; A brave plant, it has fought a brave
fight, and has its just deserts&mdash;as everything in Nature has&mdash;and
so has won.&nbsp; But did all the powers of the universe combine to
prevent it growing?&nbsp; Is not that a one-sided statement of facts?&nbsp;
Did not all the powers of the universe also combine to make it grow,
if only it had valour and worth wherewith to grow?&nbsp; Did not the
rains feed it, the very mortar in the wall give lime to its roots?&nbsp;
Were not electricity, gravitation, and I know not what of chemical and
mechanical forces, busy about the little plant, and every cell of it,
kindly and patiently ready to help it if it would only help itself?&nbsp;
Surely this is true; true of every organic thing, animal and vegetable,
and mineral too, for aught I know: and so we must soften our sadness
at the sight of the universal mutual war by the sight of an equally
universal mutual help.</p>
<p>But more.&nbsp; It is true&mdash;too true if you will&mdash;that
all things live on each other.&nbsp; But is it not, therefore, equally
true that all things live for each other?&mdash;that self-sacrifice,
and not selfishness, is at the bottom the law of Nature, as it is the
law of Grace; and the law of bio-geology, as it is the law of all religion
and virtue worthy of the name?&nbsp; Is it not true that everything
has to help something else to live, whether it knows it or not?&mdash;that
not a plant or an animal can turn again to its dust without giving food
and existence to other plants, other animals?&mdash;that the very tiger,
seemingly the most useless tyrant of all tyrants, is still of use, when,
after sending out of the world suddenly, and all but painlessly, many
an animal which would without him have starved in misery through a diseased
old age, he himself dies, and, in dying, gives, by his own carcase,
the means of life and of enjoyment to a thousandfold more living creatures
than ever his paws destroyed?</p>
<p>And so, the longer one watches the great struggle for existence,
the more charitable, the more hopeful, one becomes; as one sees that,
consciously or unconsciously, the law of Nature is, after all self-sacrifice:
unconscious in plants and animals, as far as we know; save always those
magnificent instances of true self-sacrifice shown by the social insects,
by ants, bees, and others, which put to shame by a civilisation truly
noble&mdash;why should I not say divine, for God ordained it?&mdash;the
selfishness and barbarism of man.&nbsp; But be that as it may, in man
the law of self-sacrifice&mdash;whether unconscious or not in the animals&mdash;rises
into consciousness just as far as he is a man; and the crowning lesson
of bio-geology may be, when we have worked it out after all, the lesson
of Christmas-tide&mdash;of the infinite self-sacrifice of God for man;
and Nature as well as religion may say to us:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Ah, could you crush that ever craving lust<br />For bliss, which
kills all bliss, and lose your life,<br />Your barren unit life, to
find again<br />A thousand times in those for whom you die&mdash;<br />So
were you men and women, and should hold<br />Your rightful rank in God&rsquo;s
great universe,<br />Wherein, in heaven or earth, by will or nature,<br />Naught
lives for self.&nbsp; All, all, from crown to base&mdash;<br />The Lamb,
before the world&rsquo;s foundation slain&mdash;<br />The angels, ministers
to God&rsquo;s elect&mdash;<br />The sun, who only shines to light the
worlds&mdash;<br />The clouds, whose glory is to die in showers&mdash;<br />The
fleeting streams, who in their ocean graves<br />Flee the decay of stagnant
self-content&mdash;<br />The oak, ennobled by the shipwright&rsquo;s
axe&mdash;<br />The soil, which yields its marrow to the flower&mdash;<br />The
flower, which feeds a thousand velvet worms<br />Born only to be prey
to every bird&mdash;<br />All spend themselves on others: and shall
man,<br />Whose twofold being is the mystic knot<br />Which couples
earth with heaven, doubly bound,<br />As being both, worm and angel,
to that service<br />By which both worms and angels hold their life,<br />Shall
he, whose every breath is debt on debt,<br />Refuse, forsooth, to be
what God has made him?<br />No; let him show himself the creatures&rsquo;
Lord<br />By free-will gift of that self-sacrifice<br />Which they,
perforce, by Nature&rsquo;s law&rsquo;s endure.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>My friends, scientific and others, if the study of bio-geology shall
help to teach you this, or anything like this, I think that though it
may not make you more happy, it may yet make you more wise; and, therefore,
what is better than being more happy, namely, more blessed.</p>

<h2>THE STUDY OF NATURAL HISTORY FOR SOLDIERS <a name="citation181"></a><a href="#footnote181">{181}</a></h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Gentlemen: When I accepted the honour of lecturing here, I took for
granted that so select an audience would expect from me not mere amusement,
but somewhat of instruction; or, if that be too ambitious a word for
me to use, at least some fresh hint&mdash;if I were able to give one&mdash;as
to how they should fulfil the ideal of military men in such an age as
this.</p>
<p>To touch on military matters, even had I been conversant with them,
seemed to me an impertinence.&nbsp; I am bound to take for granted that
every man knows his own business best; and I incline more and more to
the opinion that military men should be left to work out the problems
of their art for themselves, without the advice or criticism of civilians.&nbsp;
But I hold&mdash;and I am sure that you will agree with me&mdash;that
if the soldier is to be thus trusted by the nation, and left to himself
to do his own work his own way, he must be educated in all practical
matters as highly as the average of educated civilians.&nbsp; He must
know all that they know, and his own art besides.&nbsp; Just as a clergyman,
being a man plus a priest, is bound to be a man, and a good man; over
and above his priesthood, so is the soldier bound to be a civilian,
and a highly-educated civilian, plus his soldierly qualities and acquirements.</p>
<p>It seemed to me, therefore, that I might, without impertinence, ask
you to consider a branch of knowledge which is becoming yearly more
and more important in the eyes of well-educated civilians; of which,
therefore, the soldier ought at least to know something, in order to
put him on a par with the general intelligence of the nation.&nbsp;
I do not say that he is to devote much time to it, or to follow it up
into specialities: but that he ought to be well grounded in its principles
and methods; that he ought to be aware of its importance and its usefulness;
that so, if he comes into contact&mdash;as he will more and more&mdash;with
scientific men, he may understand them, respect them, befriend them,
and be befriended by them in turn; and how desirable this last result
is, I shall tell you hereafter.</p>
<p>There are those, I doubt not, among my audience who do not need the
advice which I shall presume to give to-night; who belong to that fast-increasing
class among officers of whom I have often said&mdash;and I have found
scientific men cordially agree with me&mdash;that they are the most
modest and the most teachable of men.&nbsp; But even in their case there
can be no harm in going over deliberately a question of such importance;
in putting it, as it were, into shape; and insisting on arguments which
may perhaps not have occurred to some of them.</p>
<p>Let me, in the first place, reassure those&mdash;if any such there
be&mdash;who may suppose, from the title of my lecture, that I am only
going to recommend them to collect weeds and butterflies, &ldquo;rats
and mice, and such small deer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Far from it.&nbsp; The honourable
title of Natural History has, and unwisely, been restricted too much
of late years to the mere study of plants and animals.&nbsp; I desire
to restore the words to their original and proper meaning&mdash;the
History of Nature; that is, of all that is born, and grows in time;
in short, of all natural objects.</p>
<p>If any one shall say&mdash;By that definition you make not only geology
and chemistry branches of natural history, but meteorology and astronomy
likewise&mdash;I cannot deny it.&nbsp; They deal each of them, with
realms of Nature.&nbsp; Geology is, literally, the natural history of
soils and lands; chemistry the natural history of compounds, organic
and inorganic; meteorology the natural history of climates; astronomy
the natural history of planetary and solar bodies.&nbsp; And more, you
cannot now study deeply any branch of what is popularly called Natural
History&mdash;that is, plants and animals&mdash;without finding it necessary
to learn something, and more and more as you go deeper, of those very
sciences.&nbsp; As the marvellous interdependence of all natural objects
and forces unfolds itself more and more, so the once separate sciences,
which treated of different classes of natural objects, are forced to
interpenetrate, as it were; and to supplement themselves by knowledge
borrowed from each other.&nbsp; Thus&mdash;to give a single instance&mdash;no
man can now be a first-rate botanist unless he be also no mean meteorologist,
no mean geologist, and&mdash;as Mr. Darwin has shown in his extraordinary
discoveries about the fertilisation of plants by insects&mdash;no mean
entomologist likewise.</p>
<p>It is difficult, therefore, and indeed somewhat unwise and unfair,
to put any limit to the term Natural History, save that it shall deal
only with nature and with matter; and shall not pretend&mdash;as some
would have it to do just now&mdash;to go out of its own sphere to meddle
with moral and spiritual matters.&nbsp; But, for practical purposes,
we may define the natural history of the causes which have made it what
it is, and filled it with the natural objects which it holds.&nbsp;
And if any one would know how to study the natural history of any given
spot as the history of the causes which have made it what it is, and
filled it with the natural objects which it holds.&nbsp; And if any
one would know how to study the natural history of a place, and how
to write it, let him read&mdash;and if he has read its delightful pages
in youth, read once again&mdash;that hitherto unrivalled little monograph,
White&rsquo;s &ldquo;Natural History of Selborne;&rdquo; and let him
then try, by the light of improved science, to do for any district where
he may be stationed, what White did for Selborne nearly one hundred
years ago.&nbsp; Let him study its plants, its animals, its soils and
rocks; and last, but not least, its scenery, as the total outcome of
what the soils, and plants, and animals, have made it.&nbsp; I say,
have made it.&nbsp; How far the nature of the soils, and the rocks will
affect the scenery of a district may be well learnt from a very clever
and interesting little book of Professor Geikie&rsquo;s, on &ldquo;The
Scenery of Scotland as affected by its Geological Structure.&rdquo;&nbsp;
How far the plants, and trees affect not merely the general beauty,
the richness or barrenness of a country, but also its very shape; the
rate at which the hills are destroyed and washed into the lowland; the
rate at which the seaboard is being removed by the action of waves&mdash;all
these are branches of study which is becoming more and more important.</p>
<p>And even in the study of animals and their effects on the vegetation,
questions of really deep interest will arise.&nbsp; You will find that
certain plants and trees cannot thrive in a district, while others can,
because the former are browsed down by cattle, or their seeds eaten
by birds, and the latter are not; that certain seeds are carried in
the coats of animals, or wafted abroad by winds&mdash;others are not;
certain trees destroyed wholesale by insects, while others are not;
that in a hundred ways the animal and vegetable life of a district act
and react upon each other, and that the climate, the average temperature,
the maximum and minimum temperatures, the rainfall, act on them, and
in the case of the vegetation, are reacted on again by them.&nbsp; The
diminution of rainfall by the destruction of forests, its increase by
replanting them, and the effect of both on the healthiness or unhealthiness
of a place&mdash;as in the case of the Mauritius, where a once healthy
island has become pestilential, seemingly from the clearing away of
the vegetation on the banks of streams&mdash;all this, though to study
it deeply requires a fair knowledge of meteorology, and even of a science
or two more, is surely well worth the attention of any educated man
who is put in charge of the health and lives of human beings.</p>
<p>You will surely agree with me that the habit of mind required for
such a study as this, is the very same as is required for successful
military study.&nbsp; In fact, I should say that the same intellect
which would develop into a great military man, would develop also into
a great naturalist.&nbsp; I say, intellect.&nbsp; The military man would
require&mdash;what the naturalist would not&mdash;over and above his
intellect, a special force of will, in order to translate his theories
into fact, and make his campaigns in the field and not merely on paper.&nbsp;
But I am speaking only of the habit of mind required for study; of that
inductive habit of mind which works, steadily and by rule, from the
known to the unknown; that habit of mind of which it has been said:
&ldquo;The habit of seeing; the habit of knowing what we see; the habit
of discerning differences and likenesses; the habit of classifying accordingly;
the habit of searching for hypotheses which shall connect and explain
those classified facts; the habit of verifying these hypotheses by applying
them to fresh facts; the habit of throwing them away bravely if they
will not fit; the habit of general patience, diligence, accuracy, reverence
for facts for their own sake, and love of truth for its own sake; in
one word, the habit of reverent and implicit obedience to the laws of
Nature, whatever they may be&mdash;these are not merely intellectual,
but also moral habits, which will stand men in practical good stead
in every affair of life, and in every question, even the most awful,
which may come before them as rational and social beings.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And specially valuable are they, surely, to the military man, the very
essence of whose study, to be successful, lies first in continuous and
accurate observation, and then in calm and judicious arrangement.</p>
<p>Therefore it is that I hold, and hold strongly, that the study of
physical science, far from interfering with an officer&rsquo;s studies,
much less unfitting for them, must assist him in them, by keeping his
mind always in the very attitude and the very temper which they require.</p>
<p>If any smile at this theory of mine, let them recollect one curious
fact: that perhaps the greatest captain of the old world was trained
by perhaps the greatest philosopher of the old world&mdash;the father
of Natural History; that Aristotle was the tutor of Alexander of Macedon.&nbsp;
I do not fancy, of course, that Aristotle taught Alexander any Natural
History.&nbsp; But this we know, that he taught him to use those very
faculties by which Aristotle became a natural historian, and many things
besides; that he called out in his pupil somewhat of his own extraordinary
powers of observation, extraordinary powers of arrangement.&nbsp; He
helped to make him a great general: but he helped to make him more&mdash;a
great politician, coloniser, discoverer.&nbsp; He instilled into him
such a sense of the importance of Natural History, that Alexander helped
him nobly in his researches; and, if Athen&aelig;us is to be believed,
gave him eight hundred talents towards perfecting his history of animals.&nbsp;
Surely it is not too much to say that this close friendship between
the natural philosopher and the soldier has changed the whole course
of civilisation to this very day.&nbsp; Do not consider me Utopian when
I tell you, that I should like to see the study of physical science
an integral part of the curriculum of every military school.&nbsp; I
would train the mind of the lad who was to become hereafter an officer
in the army&mdash;and in the navy likewise&mdash;by accustoming him
to careful observation of, and sound thought about, the face of nature;
of the commonest objects under his feet, just as much as the stars above
his head; provided always that he learnt, not at second-hand from books,
but where alone ho can really learn either war or nature&mdash;in the
field; by actual observation, actual experiment.&nbsp; A laboratory
for chemical experiment is a good thing, it is true, as far as it goes;
but I should prefer to the laboratory a naturalists&rsquo; field-club,
such as are prospering now at several of the best public schools, certain
that the boys would get more of sound inductive habits of mind, as well
as more health, manliness, and cheerfulness, amid scenes to remember
which will be a joy for ever, than they ever can by bending over retorts
and crucibles, amid smells even to remember which is a pain for ever.</p>
<p>But I would, whether a field-club existed or not, require of every
young man entering the army or navy&mdash;indeed of every young man
entering any liberal profession whatsoever&mdash;a fair knowledge, such
as would enable him to pass an examination, in what the Germans call
<i>Erd-kunde</i>&mdash;earth-lore&mdash;in that knowledge of the face
of the earth and of its products, for which we English have as yet cared
so little that we have actually no English name for it, save the clumsy
and questionable one of physical geography; and, I am sorry to say,
hardly any readable school books about it, save Keith Johnston&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Physical Atlas&rdquo;&mdash;an acquaintance with which last I
should certainly require of young men.</p>
<p>It does seem most strange&mdash;or rather will seem most strange
a hundred years hence&mdash;that we, the nation of colonists, the nation
of sailors, the nation of foreign commerce, the nation of foreign military
stations, the nation of travellers for travelling&rsquo;s sake, the
nation of which one man here and another there&mdash;as Schleiden sets
forth in his book, &ldquo;The Plant,&rdquo; in a charming ideal conversation
at the Travellers&rsquo; Club&mdash;has seen and enjoyed more of the
wonders and beauties of this planet than the men of any nation, not
even excepting the Germans&mdash;that this nation, I say, should as
yet have done nothing, or all but nothing, to teach in her schools a
knowledge of that planet, of which she needs to know more, and can if
she will know more, than any other nation upon it.</p>
<p>As for the practical utility of such studies to a soldier, I only
need, I trust, to hint at it to such an assembly as this.&nbsp; All
must see of what advantage a rough knowledge of the botany of a district
would be to an officer leading an exploring party, or engaged in bush
warfare.&nbsp; To know what plants are poisonous; what plants, too,
are eatable&mdash;and many more are eatable than is usually supposed;
what plants yield oleaginous substances, whether for food or for other
uses; what plants yield vegetable acids, as preventives of scurvy; what
timbers are available for each of many different purposes; what will
resist wet, salt-water, and the attacks of insects; what, again, can
be used, at a pinch, for medicine or for styptics&mdash;and be sure,
as a wise West Indian doctor once said to me, that there is more good
medicine wild in the bush than there is in all the druggists&rsquo;
shops&mdash;surely all this is a knowledge not beneath the notice of
any enterprising officer, above all of an officer of engineers.&nbsp;
I only ask any one who thinks that I may be in the right, to glance
through the lists of useful vegetable products given in Lindley&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Vegetable Kingdom&rdquo;&mdash;a miracle of learning&mdash;and
see the vast field open still to a thoughtful and observant man, even
while on service; and not to forget that such knowledge, if he should
hereafter leave the service and settle, as many do, in a distant land,
may be a solid help to his future prosperity.&nbsp; So strongly do I
feel on this matter, that I should like to see some knowledge at least
of Dr. Oliver&rsquo;s excellent little &ldquo;First Book of Indian Botany&rdquo;
required of all officers going to our Indian Empire: but as that will
not be, at least for many a year to come, I recommend any gentlemen
going to India to get that book, and while away the hours of the outward
voyage by acquiring knowledge which will be a continual source of interest,
and it may be now and then of profit, to them during their stay abroad.</p>
<p>And for geology, again.&nbsp; As I do not expect you all, or perhaps
any of you, to become such botanists as General Monro, whose recent
&ldquo;Monograph of the Bamboos&rdquo; is an honour to British botanists,
and a proof of the scientific power which is to be found here and there
among British officers: so I do not expect you to become such geologists
as Sir Roderick Murchison, or even to add such a grand chapter to the
history of extinct animals as Major Cautley did by his discoveries in
the Sewalik Hills.&nbsp; Nevertheless, you can learn&mdash;and I should
earnestly advise you to learn&mdash;geology and mineralogy enough to
be of great use to you in your profession, and of use, too, should you
relinquish your profession hereafter.&nbsp; It must be profitable for
any man, and specially for you, to know how and where to find good limestone,
building stone, road metal; it must be good to be able to distinguish
ores and mineral products; it must be good to know&mdash;as a geologist
will usually know, even in a country which he sees for the first time&mdash;where
water is likely to be found, and at what probable depth; it must be
good to know whether the water is fit for drinking or not, whether it
is unwholesome or merely muddy; it must be good to know what spots are
likely to be healthy, and what unhealthy, for encamping.&nbsp; The two
last questions depend, doubtless, on meteorological as well as geological
accidents: but the answers to them will be most surely found out by
the scientific man, because the facts connected with them are, like
all other facts, determined by natural laws.&nbsp; After what one has
heard, in past years, of barracks built in spots plainly pestilential;
of soldiers encamped in ruined cities, reeking with the dirt and poison
of centuries; of&mdash;but it is not my place to find fault; all I will
say is, that the wise and humane officer, when once his eyes are opened
to the practical value of physical science, will surely try to acquaint
himself somewhat with those laws of drainage and of climate, geological,
meteorological, chemical, which influence, often with terrible suddenness
and fury, the health of whole armies.&nbsp; He will not find it beyond
his province to ascertain the amount and period of rainfalls, the maxima
of heat and of cold which his troops may have to endure, and many another
point on which their health and efficiency&mdash;nay, their very life
may depend, but which are now too exclusively delegated to the doctor,
to whose province they do not really belong.&nbsp; For cure, I take
the liberty of believing, is the duty of the medical officer; prevention,
that of the military.</p>
<p>Thus much I can say just now&mdash;and there is much more to be said&mdash;on
the practical uses of the study of Natural History.&nbsp; But let me
remind you, on the other side, if Natural History will help you, you
in return can help her; and would, I doubt not, help her and help scientific
men at home, if once you looked fairly and steadily at the immense importance
of Natural History&mdash;of the knowledge of the &ldquo;face of the
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; I believe that all will one day feel, more or less,
that to know the earth <i>on</i> which we live, and the laws of it <i>by</i>
which we live, is a sacred duty to ourselves, to our children after
us, and to all whom we may have to command and to influence; ay, and
a duty to God likewise.&nbsp; For is it not a duty of common reverence
and faith towards Him, if He has put us into a beautiful and wonderful
place, and given us faculties by which we can see, and enjoy, and use
that place&mdash;is it not a duty of reverence and faith towards Him
to use these faculties, and to learn the lessons which He has laid open
for us?&nbsp; If you feel that, as I think you all will some day feel,
then you will surely feel likewise that it will be a good deed&mdash;I
do not say a necessary duty, but still a good deed and praiseworthy&mdash;to
help physical science forward; and to add your contributions, however
small, to our general knowledge of the earth.&nbsp; And how much may
be done for science by British officers, especially on foreign stations,
I need not point out.&nbsp; I know that much has been done, chivalrously
and well, by officers; and that men of science owe them and give them
hearty thanks for their labours.&nbsp; But I should like, I confess,
to see more done still.&nbsp; I should like to see every foreign station
what one or two highly-educated officers might easily make it, an advanced
post of physical science, in regular communication with our scientific
societies at home, sending to them accurate and methodic details of
the natural history of each district&mdash;details ninety-nine hundredths
of which might seem worthless in the eyes of the public, but which would
all be precious in the eyes of scientific men, who know that no fact
is really unimportant; and more, that while plodding patiently through
seemingly unimportant facts, you may stumble on one of infinite importance,
both scientific and practical.&nbsp; For the student of nature, gentlemen,
if he will be but patient, diligent, methodical, is liable at any moment
to the same good fortune as befell Saul of old, when he went out to
seek his father&rsquo;s asses, and found a kingdom.</p>
<p>There are those, lastly, who have neither time nor taste for the
technicalities and nice distinctions of formal Natural History; who
enjoy Nature, but as artists or as sportsmen, and not as men of science.&nbsp;
Let them follow their bent freely: but let them not suppose that in
following it they can do nothing towards enlarging our knowledge of
Nature, especially when on foreign stations.&nbsp; So far from it, drawings
ought always to be valuable, whether of plants, animals, or scenery,
provided only they are accurate; and the more spirited and full of genius
they are, the more accurate they are certain to be; for Nature being
alive, a lifeless copy of her is necessarily an untrue copy.&nbsp; Most
thankful to any officer for a mere sight of sketches will be the closest
botanist, who, to his own sorrow, knows three-fourths of his plants
only from dried specimens; or the closest zoologist, who knows his animals
from skins and bones.&nbsp; And if any one answers&mdash;But I cannot
draw.&nbsp; I rejoin.&nbsp; You can at least photograph.&nbsp; If a
young officer, going out to foreign parts, and knowing nothing at all
about physical science, did me the honour to ask me what he could do
for science, I should tell him&mdash;Learn to photograph; take photographs
of every strange bit of rock-formation which strikes your fancy, and
of every widely-extended view which may give a notion of the general
lie of the country.&nbsp; Append, if you can, a note or two, saying
whether a plain is rich or barren; whether the rock is sandstone, limestone,
granitic, metamorphic, or volcanic lava; and if there be more rocks
than one, which of them lies on the other; and send them to be exhibited
at a meeting of the Geological Society.&nbsp; I doubt not that the learned
gentlemen there will find in your photographs a valuable hint or two,
for which they will be much obliged.&nbsp; I learnt, for instance, what
seemed to me most valuable geological lessons from mere glances at drawings&mdash;I
believe from photographs&mdash;of the Abyssinian ranges about Magdala.</p>
<p>Or again, let a man, if he knows nothing of botany, not trouble himself
with collecting and drying specimens; let him simply photograph every
strange and new tree or plant he sees, to give a general notion of its
species, its look; let him append, where he can, a photograph of its
leafage, flower, fruit; and send them to Dr. Hooker, or any distinguished
botanist: and he will find that, though he may know nothing of botany,
he will have pretty certainly increased the knowledge of those who do
know.</p>
<p>The sportsman, again&mdash;I mean the sportsman of that type which
seems peculiar to these islands, who loves toil and danger for their
own sakes; he surely is a naturalist, ipso facto, though he knows it
not.&nbsp; He has those very habits of keen observation on which all
sound knowledge of nature is based; and he, if he will&mdash;as he may
do without interfering with his sport&mdash;can study the habits of
the animals among whom he spends wholesome and exciting days.&nbsp;
You have only to look over such good old books as Williams&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wild
Sports of the East,&rdquo; Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Old Forest Ranger,&rdquo;
Lloyd&rsquo;s &ldquo;Scandinavian Adventures,&rdquo; and last, but not
least, Waterton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wanderings,&rdquo; to see what valuable
additions to true zoology&mdash;the knowledge of live creatures, not
merely dead ones&mdash;British sportsmen have made, and still can make.&nbsp;
And as for the employment of time, which often hangs so heavily on a
soldier&rsquo;s hands, really I am ready to say, if you are neither
men of science, nor draughtsmen, nor sportsmen, why, go and collect
beetles.&nbsp; It is not very dignified, I know, nor exciting: but it
will be something to do.&nbsp; It cannot harm you, if you take, as beetle-hunters
do, an indiarubber sheet to lie on; and it will certainly benefit science.&nbsp;
Moreover, there will be a noble humility in the act.&nbsp; You will
confess to the public that you consider yourself only fit to catch beetles;
by which very confession you will prove yourself fit for much finer
things than catching beetles; and meanwhile, as I said before, you will
be at least out of harm&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; At a foreign barrack once,
the happiest officer I met, because the most regularly employed, was
one who spent his time in collecting butterflies.&nbsp; He knew nothing
about them scientifically&mdash;not even their names.&nbsp; He took
them simply for their wonderful beauty and variety; and in the hope,
too&mdash;in which he was really scientific&mdash;that if he carefully
kept every form which he saw, his collection might be of use some day
to entomologists at home.&nbsp; A most pleasant gentleman he was; and,
I doubt not, none the worse soldier for his butterfly catching.&nbsp;
Commendable, also, in my eyes, was another officer&mdash;whom I have
not the pleasure of knowing&mdash;who, on a remote foreign station,
used wisely to escape from the temptations of the world into an entirely
original and most pleasant hermitage.&nbsp; For finding&mdash;so the
story went&mdash;that many of the finest insects kept to the tree-tops,
and never came to ground at all, he used to settle himself among the
boughs of some tree in the tropic forests, with a long-handled net and
plenty of cigars, and pass his hours in that airy flower-garden, making
dashes every now and then at some splendid monster as it fluttered round
his head.&nbsp; His example need not be followed by every one; but it
must be allowed that&mdash;at least as long as he was in his tree&mdash;he
was neither dawdling, grumbling, spending money, nor otherwise harming
himself, and perhaps his fellow-creatures, from sheer want of employment.</p>
<p>One word more, and I have done.&nbsp; If I was allowed to give one
special piece of advice to a young officer, whether of the army or navy,
I would say: Respect scientific men; associate with them; learn from
them; find them to be, as you will usually, the most pleasant and instructive
of companions&mdash;but always respect them.&nbsp; Allow them chivalrously,
you who have an acknowledged rank, their yet unacknowledged rank; and
treat them as all the world will treat them in a higher and truer state
of civilisation.&nbsp; They do not yet wear the Queen&rsquo;s uniform;
they are not yet accepted servants of the State; as they will be in
some more perfectly organised and civilised land: but they are soldiers
nevertheless, and good soldiers and chivalrous, fighting their nation&rsquo;s
battle, often on even less pay than you, and with still less chance
of promotion and of fame, against most real and fatal enemies&mdash;against
ignorance of the laws of this planet, and all the miseries which that
ignorance begets.&nbsp; Honour them for their work; sympathise in it;
give them a helping hand in it whenever you have an opportunity&mdash;and
what opportunities you have, I have been trying to sketch for you to-night;
and more, work at it yourselves whenever and wherever you can.&nbsp;
Show them that the spirit which animates them&mdash;the hatred of ignorance
and disorder, and of their bestial consequences&mdash;animates you likewise;
show them that the habit of mind which they value in themselves&mdash;the
habit of accurate observation and careful judgment&mdash;is your habit
likewise; show them that you value science, not merely because it gives
better weapons of destruction and of defence, but because it helps you
to become clear-headed, large-minded, able to take a just and accurate
view of any subject which comes before you, and to cast away every old
prejudice and every hasty judgment in the face of truth and of duty:
and it will be better for you and for them.</p>
<p>But why?&nbsp; What need for the soldier and the man of science to
fraternise just now?&nbsp; This need: the two classes which will have
an increasing, it may be a preponderating, influence on the fate of
the human race for some time, will be the pupils of Aristotle and those
of Alexander&mdash;the men of science and the soldiers.&nbsp; In spite
of all appearances, and all declamations to the contrary, that is my
firm conviction.&nbsp; They, and they alone, will be left to rule; because
they alone, each in his own sphere, have learnt to obey.&nbsp; It is
therefore most needful for the welfare of society that they should pull
with, and not against each other; that they should understand each other,
respect each other, take counsel with each other, supplement each other&rsquo;s
defects, bring out each other&rsquo;s higher tendencies, counteract
each other&rsquo;s lower ones.&nbsp; The scientific man has something
to learn of you, gentlemen, which I doubt not that he will learn in
good time.&nbsp; You, again, have&mdash;as I have been hinting to you
to-night&mdash;something to learn of him, which you, I doubt not, will
learn in good time likewise.&nbsp; Repeat, each of you according to
his powers, the old friendship between Aristotle and Alexander; and
so, from your mutual sympathy and co-operation, a class of thinkers
and actors may yet arise which can save this nation, and the other civilised
nations of the world, from that of which I had rather not speak, and
wish that I did not think too often and too earnestly.</p>
<p>I may be a dreamer; and I may consider, in my turn, as wilder dreamers
than myself, certain persons who fancy that their only business in life
is to make money, the scientific man&rsquo;s only business is to show
them how to make money, and the soldier&rsquo;s only business to guard
their money for them.&nbsp; Be that as it may, the finest type of civilised
man which we are likely to see for some generations to come, will be
produced by a combination of the truly military with the truly scientific
man.&nbsp; I say&mdash;I may be a dreamer; but you at least, as well
as my scientific friends, will bear with me; for my dream is to your
honour.</p>

<h2>SUPERSTITION <a name="citation201"></a><a href="#footnote201">{201}</a></h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Having accepted the very great honour of being allowed to deliver
here two lectures, I have chosen as my subject Superstition and Science.&nbsp;
It is with Superstition that this first lecture will deal.</p>
<p>The subject seems to me especially fit for a clergyman; for he should,
more than other men, be able to avoid trenching on two subjects rightly
excluded from this Institution; namely, Theology&mdash;that is, the
knowledge of God; and Religion&mdash;that is, the knowledge of Duty.&nbsp;
If he knows, as he should, what is Theology, and what is Religion, then
he should best know what is not Theology, and what is not Religion.</p>
<p>For my own part, I entreat you at the outset to keep in mind that
these lectures treat of matters entirely physical; which have in reality,
and ought to have in our minds, no more to do with Theology and Religion
than the proposition that theft is wrong, has to do with the proposition
that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles.</p>
<p>It is necessary to premise this, because many are of opinion that
superstition is a corruption of religion; and though they would agree
that as such, &ldquo;corruptio optimi pessima,&rdquo; yet they would
look on religion as the state of spiritual health, and superstition
as one of spiritual disease.</p>
<p>Others again, holding the same notion, but not considering that &ldquo;corruptio
optimi pessima,&rdquo; have been in all ages somewhat inclined to be
merciful to superstition, as a child of reverence; as a mere accidental
misdirection of one of the noblest and most wholesome faculties of man.</p>
<p>This is not the place wherein to argue with either of these parties:
and I shall simply say that superstition seems to me altogether a physical
affection, as thoroughly material and corporeal as those of eating or
sleeping, remembering or dreaming.</p>
<p>After this, it will be necessary to define superstition, in order
to have some tolerably clear understanding of what we are talking about.&nbsp;
I beg leave to define it as&mdash;Fear of the unknown.</p>
<p>Johnson, who was no dialectician, and, moreover, superstitious enough
himself, gives eight different definitions of the word; which is equivalent
to confessing his inability to define it at all:</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; Unnecessary fear or scruples in religion; observance
of unnecessary and uncommanded rites or practices; religion without
morality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; False religion; reverence of beings not proper objects
of reverence; false worship.</p>
<p>&ldquo; 3.&nbsp; Over nicety; exactness too scrupulous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eight meanings; which, on the principle that eight eighths, or indeed
eight hundred, do not make one whole, may be considered as no definition.&nbsp;
His first thought, as often happens, is the best&mdash;&ldquo;Unnecessary
fear.&rdquo;&nbsp; But after that he wanders.&nbsp; The root-meaning
of the word is still to seek.&nbsp; But, indeed, the popular meaning,
thanks to popular common sense, will generally be found to contain in
itself the root-meaning.</p>
<p>Let us go back to the Latin word Superstitio.&nbsp; Cicero says that
the superstitious element consists in &ldquo;a certain empty dread of
the gods&rdquo;&mdash;a purely physical affection, if you will remember
three things:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That dread is in itself a physical affection.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That the gods who were dreaded were, with the vulgar, who
alone dreaded them, merely impersonations of the powers of nature.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; That it was physical injury which these gods were expected
to inflict.</p>
<p>But he himself agrees with this theory of mine; for he says shortly
after, that not only philosophers, but even the ancient Romans, had
separated superstition from religion; and that the word was first applied
to those who prayed all day <i>ut liberi sui sibi superstites essent</i>,
might survive them.&nbsp; On the etymology no one will depend who knows
the remarkable absence of any etymological instinct in the ancients,
in consequence of their weak grasp of that sound inductive method which
has created modern criticism.&nbsp; But if it be correct, it is a natural
and pathetic form for superstition to take in the minds of men who saw
their children fade and die; probably the greater number of them beneath
diseases which mankind could neither comprehend nor cure.</p>
<p>The best exemplification of what the ancients meant by superstition
is to be found in the lively and dramatic words of Aristotle&rsquo;s
great pupil Theophrastus.</p>
<p>The superstitious man, according to him, after having washed his
hands with lustral water&mdash;that is, water in which a torch from
the altar had been quenched&mdash;goes about with a laurel-leaf in his
mouth, to keep off evil influences, as the pigs in Devonshire used,
in my youth, to go about with a withe of mountain ash round their necks
to keep off the evil eye.&nbsp; If a weasel crosses his path, he stops,
and either throws three pebbles into the road, or, with the innate selfishness
of fear, lets someone else go before him, and attract to himself the
harm which may ensue.&nbsp; He has a similar dread of a screech-owl,
whom he compliments in the name of its mistress, Pallas Athene.&nbsp;
If he finds a serpent in his house, he sets up an altar to it.&nbsp;
If he pass at a four-cross-way an anointed stone, he pours oil on it,
kneels down, and adores it.&nbsp; If a rat has nibbled one of his sacks
he takes it for a fearful portent&mdash;a superstition which Cicero
also mentions.&nbsp; He dare not sit on a tomb, because it would be
assisting at his own funeral.&nbsp; He purifies endlessly his house,
saying that Hecate&mdash;that is, the moon&mdash;has exercised some
malign influence on it; and many other purifications he observes, of
which I shall only say that they are by their nature plainly, like the
last, meant as preservatives against unseen malarias or contagions,
possible or impossible.&nbsp; He assists every month with his children
at the mysteries of the Orphic priests; and finally, whenever he sees
an epileptic patient, he spits in his own bosom to avert the evil omen.</p>
<p>I have quoted, I believe, every fact given by Theophrastus; and you
will agree, I am sure, that the moving and inspiring element of such
a character is mere bodily fear of unknown evil.&nbsp; The only superstition
attributed to him which does not at first sight seem to have its root
in dread is that of the Orphic mysteries.&nbsp; But of them M&uuml;ller
says that the Dionusos whom they worshipped &ldquo;was an infernal deity,
connected with Hades, and was the personification, not merely of rapturous
pleasure, but of a deep sorrow for the miseries of human life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Orphic societies of Greece seem to have been peculiarly ascetic,
taking no animal food save raw flesh from the sacrificed ox of Dionusos.&nbsp;
And Plato speaks of a lower grade of Orphic priests, Orpheotelestai,
&ldquo;who used to come before the doors of the rich, and promise, by
sacrifices and expiatory songs, to release them from their own sins,
and those of their forefathers;&rdquo; and such would be but too likely
to get a hearing from the man who was afraid of a weasel or an owl.</p>
<p>Now, this same bodily fear, I verily believe, will be found at the
root of all superstition whatsoever.</p>
<p>But be it so.&nbsp; Fear is a natural passion, and a wholesome one.&nbsp;
Without the instinct of self-preservation, which causes the sea-anemone
to contract its tentacles, or the fish to dash into its hover, species
would be extermined wholesale by involuntary suicide.</p>
<p>Yes; fear is wholesome enough, like all other faculties, as long
as it is controlled by reason.&nbsp; But what if the fear be not rational,
but irrational?&nbsp; What if it be, in plain homely English, blind
fear; fear of the unknown, simply because it is unknown?&nbsp; Is it
not likely, then, to be afraid of the wrong object? to be hurtful, ruinous
to animals as well as to man?&nbsp; Any one will confess that, who has
ever seen, a horse inflict on himself mortal injuries, in his frantic
attempts to escape from a quite imaginary danger.&nbsp; I have good
reasons for believing that not only animals here and there, but whole
flocks and swarms of them, are often destroyed, even in the wild state,
by mistaken fear; by such panics, for instance, as cause a whole herd
of buffaloes to rush over a bluff, and be dashed to pieces.&nbsp; And
remark that this capacity of panic, fear&mdash;of superstition, as I
should call it&mdash;is greatest in those animals, the dog and the horse
for instance, which have the most rapid and vivid fancy.&nbsp; Does
not the unlettered Highlander say all that I want to say, when he attributes
to his dog and his horse, on the strength of these very manifestations
of fear, the capacity of seeing ghosts and fairies before he can see
them himself?</p>
<p>But blind fear not only causes evil to the coward himself: it makes
him a source of evil to others; for it is the cruellest of all human
states.&nbsp; It transforms the man into the likeness of the cat, who,
when she is caught in a trap, or shut up in a room, has too low an intellect
to understand that you wish to release her: and, in the madness of terror,
bites and tears at the hand which tries to do her good.&nbsp; Yes; very
cruel is blind fear.&nbsp; When a man dreads he knows not what, he will
do he cares not what.&nbsp; When he dreads desperately, he will act
desperately.&nbsp; When he dreads beyond all reason, he will behave
beyond all reason.&nbsp; He has no law of guidance left, save the lowest
selfishness.&nbsp; No law of guidance: and yet his intellect, left unguided,
may be rapid and acute enough to lead him into terrible follies.&nbsp;
Infinitely more imaginative than the lowest animals, he is for that
very reason capable of being infinitely more foolish, more cowardly,
more superstitious.&nbsp; He can&mdash;what the lower animals, happily
for them, cannot&mdash;organise his folly; erect his superstitions into
a science; and create a whole mythology out of his blind fear of the
unknown.&nbsp; And when he has done that&mdash;Woe to the weak!&nbsp;
For when he has reduced his superstition to a science, then he will
reduce his cruelty to a science likewise, and write books like the &ldquo;Malleus
Maleficarum,&rdquo; and the rest of the witch literature of the fifteenth,
sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries; of which Mr. Lecky has of late
told the world so much, and told it most faithfully and most fairly.</p>
<p>But, fear of the unknown?&nbsp; Is not that fear of the unseen world?&nbsp;
And is not that fear of the spiritual world?&nbsp; Pardon me: a great
deal of that fear&mdash;all of it, indeed, which is superstition&mdash;is
simply not fear of the spiritual, but of the material; and of nothing
else.</p>
<p>The spiritual world&mdash;I beg you to fix this in your minds&mdash;is
not merely an invisible world which may become visible, but an invisible
world which is by its essence invisible; a moral world, a world of right
and wrong.&nbsp; And spiritual fear&mdash;which is one of the noblest
of all affections, as bodily fear is one of the basest&mdash;is, if
properly defined, nothing less or more than the fear of doing wrong;
of becoming a worse man.</p>
<p>But what has that to do with mere fear of the unseen?&nbsp; The fancy
which conceives the fear is physical, not spiritual.&nbsp; Think for
yourselves.&nbsp; What difference is there between a savage&rsquo;s
fear of a demon, and a hunter&rsquo;s fear of a fall?&nbsp; The hunter
sees a fence.&nbsp; He does not know what is on the other side, but
he has seen fences like it with a great ditch on the other side, and
suspects one here likewise.&nbsp; He has seen horses fall at such, and
men hurt thereby.&nbsp; He pictures to himself his horse falling at
that fence, himself rolling in the ditch, with possibly a broken limb;
and he recoils from the picture he himself has made; and perhaps with
very good reason.&nbsp; His picture may have its counterpart in fact;
and he may break his leg.&nbsp; But his picture, like the previous pictures
from which it was compounded, is simply a physical impression on the
brain, just as much as those in dreams.</p>
<p>Now, does the fact of the ditch, the fall, and the broken leg, being
unseen and unknown, make them a spiritual ditch, a spiritual fall, a
spiritual broken leg?&nbsp; And does the fact of the demon and his doings,
being as yet unseen and unknown, make them spiritual, or the harm that
he may do, a spiritual harm?&nbsp; What does the savage fear?&nbsp;
Lest the demon should appear; that is, become obvious to his physical
senses, and produce an unpleasant physical effect on them.&nbsp; He
fears lest the fiend should entice him into the bog, break the hand-bridge
over the brook, turn into a horse and ride away with him, or jump out
from behind a tree and wring his neck&mdash;tolerably hard physical
facts, all of them; the children of physical fancy, regarded with physical
dread.&nbsp; Even if the superstition proved true; even if the demon
did appear; even if he wrung the traveller&rsquo;s neck in sound earnest,
there would be no more spiritual agency or phenomenon in the whole tragedy
than there is in the parlour-table, when spiritual somethings make spiritual
raps upon spiritual wood; and human beings, who are really spirits&mdash;and
would to heaven they would remember that fact, and what it means&mdash;believe
that anything has happened beyond a clumsy juggler&rsquo;s trick.</p>
<p>You demur?&nbsp; Do you not see that the demon, by the mere fact
of having produced physical consequences, would have become himself
a physical agent, a member of physical Nature, and therefore to be explained,
he and his doings, by physical laws?&nbsp; If you do not see that conclusion
at first sight, think over it till you do.</p>
<p>It may seem to some that I have founded my theory on a very narrow
basis; that I am building up an inverted pyramid; or that, considering
the numberless, complex, fantastic shapes which superstition has assumed,
bodily fear is too simple to explain them all.</p>
<p>But if those persons will think a second time, they must agree that
my base is as broad as the phenomena which it explains; for every man
is capable of fear.&nbsp; And they will see, too, that the cause of
superstition must be something like fear, which is common to all men:
for all, at least as children, are capable of superstition; and that
it must be something which, like fear, is of a most simple, rudimentary,
barbaric kind; for the lowest savage, of whatever he is not capable,
is still superstitious, often to a very ugly degree.&nbsp; Superstition
seems, indeed, to be, next to the making of stone-weapons, the earliest
method of asserting his superiority to the brutes which has occurred
to that utterly abnormal and fantastic <i>lusus natur&aelig;</i> called
man.</p>
<p>Now let us put ourselves awhile, as far as we can, in the place of
that same savage; and try whether my theory will not justify itself;
whether or not superstition, with all its vagaries, may have been, indeed
must have been, the result of that ignorance and fear which he carried
about with him, every time he prowled for food through the primeval
forest.</p>
<p>A savage&rsquo;s first division of nature would be, I should say,
into things which he can eat and things which can eat him: including,
of course, his most formidable enemy, and most savoury food&mdash;his
fellow-man.&nbsp; In finding out what he can eat, we must remember,
he will have gone through much experience which will have inspired him
with a serious respect for the hidden wrath of nature; like those Himalayan
folk, of whom Hooker says, that as they know every poisonous plant,
they must have tried them all&mdash;not always with impunity.</p>
<p>So he gets at a third class of objects&mdash;things which he cannot
eat, and which will not eat him; but will only do him harm, as it seems
to him, out of pure malice, like poisonous plants and serpents.&nbsp;
There are natural accidents, too, which fall into the same category,
stones, floods, fires, avalanches.&nbsp; They hurt him or kill him,
surely for ends of their own.&nbsp; If a rock falls from the cliff above
him, what more natural than to suppose that there is some giant up there
who threw it at him?&nbsp; If he had been up there, and strong enough,
and had seen a man walking underneath, he would certainly have thrown
the stone at him and killed him.&nbsp; For first, he might have eaten
the man after; and even if he were not hungry, the man might have done
him a mischief; and it was prudent to prevent that by doing him a mischief
first.&nbsp; Besides, the man might have a wife; and if he killed the
man, then the wife would, by a very ancient law common to man and animals,
become the prize of the victor.&nbsp; Such is the natural man, the carnal
man, the soulish man, the &alpha;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&phi;&upsilon;&chi;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf; of St. Paul, with
five tolerably acute senses, which are ruled by five very acute animal
passions&mdash;hunger, sex, rage, vanity, fear.&nbsp; It is with the
working of the last passion, fear, that this lecture has to do.</p>
<p>So the savage concludes that there must be a giant living in the
cliff, who threw stones at him, with evil intent; and he concludes in
like wise concerning most other natural phenomena.&nbsp; There is something
in them which will hurt him, and therefore likes to hurt him; and if
he cannot destroy them, and so deliver himself, his fear of them grows
quite boundless.&nbsp; There are hundreds of natural objects on which
he learns to look with the same eyes as the little boys of Teneriffe
look on the useless and poisonous <i>Euphorbia canariensis</i>.&nbsp;
It is to them&mdash;according to Mr. Piazzi Smyth&mdash;a demon who
would kill them, if it could only run after them; but as it cannot,
they shout Spanish curses at it, and pelt it with volleys of stones,
&ldquo;screeching with elfin joy, and using worse names than ever, when
the poisonous milk spurts out from its bruised stalks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And if such be the attitude of the uneducated man towards the permanent
terrors of nature, what will it be towards those which are sudden and
seemingly capricious?&mdash;towards storms, earthquakes, floods, blights,
pestilences?&nbsp; We know too well what it has been&mdash;one of blind,
and therefore often cruel, fear.&nbsp; How could it be otherwise?&nbsp;
Was Theophrastus&rsquo;s superstitious man so very foolish for pouring
oil on every round stone?&nbsp; I think there was a great deal to be
said for him.&nbsp; This worship of B&aelig;tyli was rational enough.&nbsp;
They were aerolites, fallen from heaven.&nbsp; Was it not as well to
be civil to such messengers from above?&mdash;to testify by homage to
them due awe of the being who had thrown them at men, and who though
he had missed his shot that time might not miss it the next?&nbsp; I
think if we, knowing nothing of either gunpowder, astronomy, or Christianity,
saw an Armstrong bolt fall within five miles of London, we should be
inclined to be very respectful to it indeed.&nbsp; So the aerolites,
or glacial boulders, or polished stone weapons of an extinct race, which
looked like aerolites, were the children of Ouranos the heaven, and
had souls in them.&nbsp; One, by one of those strange transformations
in which the logic of unreason indulges, the image of Diana of the Ephesians,
which fell down from Jupiter; another was the Ancile, the holy shield
which fell from the same place in the days of Numa Pompilius, and was
the guardian genius of Rome; and several more became notable for ages.</p>
<p>Why not?&nbsp; The uneducated man of genius, unacquainted alike with
metaphysics and with biology, sees, like a child, a personality in every
strange and sharply-defined object.&nbsp; A cloud like an angel may
be an angel; a bit of crooked root like a man may be a man turned into
wood&mdash;perhaps to be turned back again at its own will.&nbsp; An
erratic block has arrived where it is by strange unknown means.&nbsp;
Is not that an evidence of its personality?&nbsp; Either it has flown
hither itself, or some one has thrown it.&nbsp; In the former case,
it has life, and is proportionally formidable; in the latter, he who
had thrown it is formidable.</p>
<p>I know two erratic blocks of porphyry&mdash;I believe there are three&mdash;in
Cornwall, lying one on serpentine, one, I think, on slate, which&mdash;so
I was always informed as a boy&mdash;were the stones which St. Kevern
threw after St. Just when the latter stole his host&rsquo;s chalice
and paten, and ran away with them to the Land&rsquo;s End.&nbsp; Why
not?&nbsp; Before we knew anything about the action of icebergs and
glaciers, that is, until the last eighty years, that was as good a story
as any other; while how lifelike these boulders are, let a great poet
testify; for the fact has not escaped the delicate eye of Wordsworth:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie<br />Couched on the bald
top of an eminence;<br />Wonder to all who do the same espy,<br />By
what means it could thither come, and whence,<br />So that it seems
a thing endued with sense;<br />Like a sea-beast crawled forth, that
on a shelf<br />Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>To the civilised poet, the fancy becomes a beautiful simile; to a
savage poet, it would have become a material and a very formidable fact.&nbsp;
He stands in the valley, and looks up at the boulder on the far-off
fells.&nbsp; He is puzzled by it.&nbsp; He fears it.&nbsp; At last he
makes up his mind.&nbsp; It is alive.&nbsp; As the shadows move over
it, he sees it move.&nbsp; May it not sleep there all day, and prowl
for prey all night?&nbsp; He had been always afraid of going up those
fells; now he will never go.&nbsp; There is a monster there.</p>
<p>Childish enough, no doubt.&nbsp; But remember that the savage is
always a child.&nbsp; So, indeed, are millions, as well clothed, housed,
and policed as ourselves&mdash;children from the cradle to the grave.&nbsp;
But of them I do not talk; because, happily for the world, their childishness
is so overlaid by the result of other men&rsquo;s manhood; by an atmosphere
of civilisation and Christianity which they have accepted at second-hand
as the conclusions of minds wiser than their own, that they do all manner
of reasonable things for bad reasons, or for no reason at all, save
the passion of imitation.&nbsp; Not in them, but in the savage, can
we see man as he is by nature, the puppet of his senses and his passions,
the natural slave of his own fears.</p>
<p>But has the savage no other faculties, save his five senses and five
passions?&nbsp; I do not say that.&nbsp; I should be most unphilosophical
if I said it; for the history of mankind proves that he has infinitely
more in him than that.&nbsp; Yes: but in him that infinite more, which
is not only the noblest part of humanity, but, it may be, humanity itself,
is not to be counted as one of the roots of superstition.&nbsp; For
in the savage man, in whom superstition certainly originates, that infinite
more is still merely in him; inside him; a faculty: but not yet a fact.&nbsp;
It has not come out of him into consciousness, purpose, and act; and
is to be treated as non-existent: while what has come out, his passions
and senses, is enough to explain all the vagaries of superstition; a
<i>vera causa</i> for all its phenomena.&nbsp; And if we seem to have
found a sufficient explanation already, it is unphilosophical to look
farther, at least till we have tried whether our explanation fits the
facts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is another faculty in the savage, to which I
have already alluded, common to him and to at least the higher vertebrates&mdash;fancy;
the power of reproducing internal images of external objects, whether
in its waking form of physical memory&mdash;if, indeed, all memory be
not physical&mdash;or in its sleeping form of dreaming.&nbsp; Upon this
last, which has played so very important a part in superstition in all
ages, I beg you to think a moment.&nbsp; Recollect your own dreams during
childhood; and recollect again that the savage is always a child.&nbsp;
Recollect how difficult it was for you in childhood, how difficult it
must be always for the savage, to decide whether dreams are phantasms
or realities.&nbsp; To the savage, I doubt not, the food he eats, the
foes he grapples with, in dreams, are as real as any waking impressions.&nbsp;
But, moreover, these dreams will be very often, as children&rsquo;s
dreams are wont to be, of a painful and terrible kind.&nbsp; Perhaps
they will be always painful; perhaps his dull brain will never dream,
save under the influence of indigestion, or hunger, or an uncomfortable
attitude.&nbsp; And so, in addition to his waking experience of the
terrors of nature, he will have a whole dream-experience besides, of
a still more terrific kind.&nbsp; He walks by day past a black cavern
mouth, and thinks, with a shudder&mdash;Something ugly may live in that
ugly hole: what if it jumped out upon me?&nbsp; He broods over the thought
with the intensity of a narrow and unoccupied mind; and a few nights
after, he has eaten&mdash;but let us draw a veil before the larder of
a savage&mdash;his chin is pinned down on his chest, a slight congestion
of the brain comes on; and behold he finds himself again at that cavern&rsquo;s
mouth, and something ugly does jump out upon him: and the cavern is
a haunted spot henceforth to him and to all his tribe.&nbsp; It is in
vain that his family tell him that he has been lying asleep at home
all the while.&nbsp; He has the evidence of his senses to prove the
contrary.&nbsp; He must have got out of himself, and gone into the woods.&nbsp;
When we remember that certain wise Greek philosophers could find no
better explanation of dreaming than that the soul left the body, and
wandered free, we cannot condemn the savage for his theory.</p>
<p>Now, I submit that in these simple facts we have a group of &ldquo;true
causes&rdquo; which are the roots of all the superstitions of the world.</p>
<p>And if any one shall complain that I am talking materialism: I shall
answer, that I am doing exactly the opposite.&nbsp; I am trying to eliminate
and get rid of that which is material, animal, and base; in order that
that which is truly spiritual may stand out, distinct and clear, in
its divine and eternal beauty.</p>
<p>To explain, and at the same time, as I think, to verify my hypothesis,
let me give you an example&mdash;fictitious, it is true, but probable
fact nevertheless; because it is patched up of many fragments of actual
fact: and let us see how, in following it out, we shall pass through
almost every possible form of superstition.</p>
<p>Suppose a great hollow tree, in which the formidable wasps of the
tropics have built for ages.&nbsp; The average savage hurries past the
spot in mere bodily fear; for if they come out against him, they will
sting him to death; till at last there comes by a savage wiser than
the rest, with more observation, reflection, imagination, independence
of will&mdash;the genius of his tribe.</p>
<p>The awful shade of the great tree, added to his terror of the wasps,
weighs on him, and excites his brain.&nbsp; Perhaps, too, he has had
a wife or a child stung to death by these same wasps.&nbsp; These wasps,
so small, yet so wise, far wiser than he: they fly, and they sting.&nbsp;
Ah, if he could fly and sting; how he would kill and eat, and live right
merrily.&nbsp; They build great towns; they rob far and wide; they never
quarrel with each other: they must have some one to teach them, to lead
them&mdash;they must have a king.&nbsp; And so he gets the fancy of
a Wasp-King; as the western Irish still believe in the Master Otter;
as the Red Men believe in the King of the Buffaloes, and find the bones
of his ancestors in the Mammoth remains of Big-bone Lick; as the Philistines
of Ekron&mdash;to quote a notorious instance&mdash;actually worshipped
Baal-zebub, lord of the flies.</p>
<p>If they have a king, he must be inside that tree, of course.&nbsp;
If he, the savage, were a king, he would not work for his bread, but
sit at home and make others feed him; and so, no doubt, does the wasp-king.</p>
<p>And when he goes home he will brood over this wonderful discovery
of the wasp-king; till, like a child, he can think of nothing else.&nbsp;
He will go to the tree, and watch for him to come out.&nbsp; The wasps
will get accustomed to his motionless figure, and leave him unhurt;
till the new fancy will rise in his mind that he is a favourite of this
wasp-king: and at last he will find himself grovelling before the tree,
saying&mdash;&ldquo;Oh great wasp-king, pity me, and tell your children
not to sting me, and I will bring you honey, and fruit, and flowers
to eat, and I will flatter you, and worship you, and you shall be my
king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he would gradually boast of his discovery; of the new mysterious
bond between him and the wasp-king; and his tribe would believe him,
and fear him; and fear him still more when he began to say, as he surely
would, not merely&mdash;&ldquo;I can ask the wasp-king, and he will
tell his children not to sting you:&rdquo; but&mdash;&ldquo;I can ask
the wasp-king, and he will send his children, and sting you all to death.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Vanity and ambition will have prompted the threat: but it will not be
altogether a lie.&nbsp; The man will more than half believe his own
words; he will quite believe them when he has repeated them a dozen
times.</p>
<p>And so he will become a great man, and a king, under the protection
of the king of the wasps; and he will become, and it may be his children
after him, priest of the wasp-king, who will be their fetish, and the
fetish of their tribe.</p>
<p>And they will prosper, under the protection of the wasp-king.&nbsp;
The wasp will become their moral ideal, whose virtues they must copy.&nbsp;
The new chief will preach to them wild eloquent words.&nbsp; They must
sting like wasps, revenge like wasps, hold altogether like wasps, build
like wasps, work hard like wasps, rob like wasps; then, like the wasps,
they will be the terror of all around, and kill and eat all their enemies.&nbsp;
Soon they will call themselves The Wasps.&nbsp; They will boast that
their king&rsquo;s father or grandfather, and soon that the ancestor
of the whole tribe was an actual wasp; and the wasp will become at once
their <i>eponym</i> hero, their deity, their ideal, their civiliser;
who has taught them to build a kraal of huts, as he taught his children
to build a hive.</p>
<p>Now, if there should come to any thinking man of this tribe, at this
epoch, the new thought&mdash;Who made the world? he will be sorely puzzled.&nbsp;
The conception of a world has never crossed his mind before.&nbsp; He
never pictured to himself anything beyond the nearest ridge of mountains;
and as for a Maker, that will be a greater puzzle still.&nbsp; What
makers or builders more cunning than those wasps of whom his foolish
head is full?&nbsp; Of course, he sees it now.&nbsp; A Wasp made the
world; which to him entirely new guess might become an integral part
of his tribe&rsquo;s creed.&nbsp; That would be their cosmogony.&nbsp;
And if, a generation or two after, another savage genius should guess
that the world was a globe hanging in the heavens, he would, if he had
imagination enough to take the thought in at all, put it to himself
in a form suited to his previous knowledge and conceptions.&nbsp; It
would seem to him that The Wasp flew about the skies with the world
in his mouth, as he carries a bluebottle fly; and that would be the
astronomy of his tribe henceforth.&nbsp; Absurd enough: but&mdash;as
every man who is acquainted with old mythical cosmogonies must know&mdash;no
more absurd than twenty similar guesses on record.&nbsp; Try to imagine
the gradual genesis of such myths as the Egyptian scarab&aelig;us and
egg, or the Hindoo theory that the world stood on an elephant, the elephant
on a tortoise, the tortoise on that infinite note of interrogation which,
as some one expresses it, underlies all physical speculations, and judge:
must they not have arisen in some such fashion as that which I have
pointed out?</p>
<p>This, I say, would be the culminating point of the wasp-worship,
which had sprung up out of bodily fear of being stung.</p>
<p>But times might come for it in which it would go through various
changes, through which every superstition in the world, I suppose, has
passed or is doomed to pass.</p>
<p>The wasp-men might be conquered, and possibly eaten, by a stronger
tribe than themselves.&nbsp; What would be the result?&nbsp; They would
fight valiantly at first, like wasps.&nbsp; But what if they began to
fail?&nbsp; Was not the wasp-king angry with them?&nbsp; Had not he
deserted them?&nbsp; He must be appeased; he must have his revenge.&nbsp;
They would take a captive, and offer him to the wasps.&nbsp; So did
a North American tribe, in their need, some forty years ago; when, because
their maize-crops failed, they roasted alive a captive girl, cut her
to pieces, and sowed her with their corn.&nbsp; I would not tell the
story, for the horror of it, did it not bear with such fearful force
on my argument.&nbsp; What were those Red Men thinking of?&nbsp; What
chain of misreasoning had they in their heads when they hit on that
as a device for making the crops grow?&nbsp; Who can tell?&nbsp; Who
can make the crooked straight, or number that which is wanting?&nbsp;
As said Solomon of old, so must we&mdash;&ldquo;The foolishness of fools
is folly.&rdquo;&nbsp; One thing only we can say of them, that they
were horribly afraid of famine, and took that means of ridding themselves
of their fear.</p>
<p>But what if the wasp tribe had no captives?&nbsp; They would offer
slaves.&nbsp; What if the agony and death of slaves did not appease
the wasps?&nbsp; They would offer their fairest, their dearest, their
sons and their daughters, to the wasps; as the Carthaginians, in like
strait, offered in one day 200 noble boys to Moloch, the volcano-god,
whose worship they had brought out of Syria; whose original meaning
they had probably forgotten; of whom they only knew that he was a dark
and devouring being, who must be appeased with the burning bodies of
their sons and daughters.&nbsp; And so the veil of fancy would be lifted
again, and the whole superstition stand forth revealed as the mere offspring
of bodily fear.</p>
<p>But more: the survivors of the conquest might, perhaps, escape, and
carry their wasp-fetish into a new land.&nbsp; But if they became poor
and weakly, their brains and imagination, degenerating with their bodies,
would degrade their wasp-worship till they knew not what it meant.&nbsp;
Away from the sacred tree, in a country the wasps of which were not
so large or formidable, they would require a remembrancer of the wasp-king;
and they would make one&mdash;a wasp of wood, or what not.&nbsp; After
a while, according to that strange law of fancy, the root of all idolatry,
which you may see at work in every child who plays with a doll, the
symbol would become identified with the thing symbolised; they would
invest the wooden wasp with all the terrible attributes which had belonged
to the live wasps of the tree; and after a few centuries, when all remembrance
of the tree, the wasp-prophet and chieftain, and his descent from the
divine wasp&mdash;ay, even of their defeat and flight&mdash;had vanished
from their songs and legends, they would be found bowing down in fear
and trembling to a little ancient wooden wasp, which came from they
knew not whence, and meant they knew not what, save that it was a very
&ldquo;old fetish,&rdquo; a &ldquo;great medicine,&rdquo; or some such
other formula for expressing their own ignorance and dread.&nbsp; Just
so do the half-savage natives of Thibet, and the Irishwomen of Kerry,
by a strange coincidence&mdash;unless the ancient Irish were Buddhists,
like the Himalayans&mdash;tie just the same scraps of rag on the bushes
round just the same holy wells, as do the Negros of Central Africa upon
their &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Trees;&rdquo; they know not why, save that
their ancestors did it, and it is a charm against ill-luck and danger.</p>
<p>And the sacred tree?&nbsp; That, too, might undergo a metamorphosis
in the minds of men.&nbsp; The conquerors would see their aboriginal
slaves of the old race still haunting the tree, making stealthy offerings
to it by night: and they would ask the reason.&nbsp; But they would
not be told.&nbsp; The secret would be guarded; such secrets were guarded,
in Greece, in Italy, in medieval France, by the superstitious awe, the
cunning, even the hidden self-conceit, of the conquered race.&nbsp;
Then the conquerors would wish to imitate their own slaves.&nbsp; They
might be in the right.&nbsp; There might be something magical, uncanny,
in the hollow tree, which might hurt them; might be jealous of them
as intruders.&nbsp; They, too, would invest the place with sacred awe.&nbsp;
If they were gloomy, like the Teutonic conquerors of Europe and the
Arabian conquerors of the East, they would invest it with unseen terrors.&nbsp;
They would say, like them, a devil lives in the tree.&nbsp; If they
were of a sunny temper, like the Hellenes, they would invest it with
unseen graces.&nbsp; What a noble tree!&nbsp; What a fair fountain hard
by its roots!&nbsp; Surely some fair and graceful being must dwell therein,
and come out to bathe by night in that clear wave.&nbsp; What meant
the fruit, the flowers, the honey, which the slaves left there by night?&nbsp;
Pure food for some pure nymph.&nbsp; The wasp-gods would be forgotten;
probably smoked out as sacrilegious intruders.&nbsp; The lucky seer
or poet who struck out the fancy would soon find imitators; and it would
become, after a while, a common and popular superstition that Hamadryads
haunted the hollow forest trees, Naiads the wells, and Oreads the lawns.&nbsp;
Somewhat thus, I presume, did the more cheerful Hellenic myths displace
the darker superstitions of the Pelasgis and those rude Arcadian tribes
who offered, even as late as the Roman Empire, human sacrifices to gods
whose original names were forgotten.</p>
<p>But even the cultus of nymphs would be defiled after awhile by a
darker element.&nbsp; However fair, they might be capricious and revengeful,
like other women.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; And soon, men going out into
the forest would be missed for awhile.&nbsp; They had eaten narcotic
berries, got sun-strokes, wandered till they lost their wits.&nbsp;
At all events, their wits were gone.&nbsp; Who had done it?&nbsp; Who
but the nymphs?&nbsp; The men had seen something they should not have
seen; done something they would not have done; and the nymphs had punished
the unconscious rudeness by that frenzy.&nbsp; Fear, everywhere fear,
of Nature&mdash;the spotted panther as some one calls her, as fair as
cruel, as playful as treacherous.&nbsp; Always fear of Nature, till
a Divine light arise, and show men that they are not the puppets of
Nature, but her lords; and that they are to fear God, and fear naught
else.</p>
<p>And so ends my true myth of the wasp-tree.&nbsp; No, it need not
end there; it may develop into a yet darker and more hideous form of
superstition, which Europe has often seen; which is common now among
the Negros; <a name="citation223"></a><a href="#footnote223">{223}</a>
which we may hope, will soon be exterminated.</p>
<p>This might happen.&nbsp; For it, or something like it, has happened
too many times already.</p>
<p>That to the ancient women who still kept up the irrational remnant
of the wasp-worship, beneath the sacred tree, other women might resort;
not merely from curiosity, or an excited imagination, but from jealousy
and revenge.&nbsp; Oppressed, as woman has always been under the reign
of brute force; beaten, outraged, deserted, at best married against
her will, she has too often gone for comfort and help&mdash;and those
of the very darkest kind&mdash;to the works of darkness; and there never
were wanting&mdash;there are not wanting, even now, in remote parts
of these isles&mdash;wicked old women who would, by help of the old
superstitions, do for her what she wished.&nbsp; Soon would follow mysterious
deaths of rivals, of husbands, of babes; then rumours of dark rites
connected with the sacred tree, with poison, with the wasp and his sting,
with human sacrifices; lies mingled with truth, more and more confused
and frantic, the more they were misinvestigated by men mad with fear:
till there would arise one of those witch-manias, which are too common
still among the African Negros, which were too common of old among the
men of our race.</p>
<p>I say, among the men.&nbsp; To comprehend a witch-mania, you must
look at it as&mdash;what the witch-literature confesses it unblushingly
to be&mdash;man&rsquo;s dread of Nature excited to its highest form,
as dread of woman.</p>
<p>She is to the barbarous man&mdash;she should be more and more to
the civilised man&mdash;not only the most beautiful and precious, but
the most wonderful and mysterious of all natural objects, if it be only
as the author of his physical being.&nbsp; She is to the savage a miracle
to be alternately adored and dreaded.&nbsp; He dreads her more delicate
nervous organisation, which often takes shapes to him demoniacal and
miraculous; her quicker instincts, her readier wit, which seem to him
to have in them somewhat prophetic and superhuman, which entangled him
as in an invisible net, and rule him against his will.&nbsp; He dreads
her very tongue, more crushing than his heaviest club, more keen than
his poisoned arrows.&nbsp; He dreads those habits of secrecy and falsehood,
the weapons of the weak, to which savage and degraded woman always has
recourse.&nbsp; He dreads the very medicinal skill which she has learnt
to exercise, as nurse, comforter, and slave.&nbsp; He dreads those secret
ceremonies, those mysterious initiations which no man may witness, which
he has permitted to her in all ages, in so many&mdash;if not all&mdash;barbarous
and semi-barbarous races, whether Negro, American, Syrian, Greek, or
Roman, as a homage to the mysterious importance of her who brings him
into the world.&nbsp; If she turns against him&mdash;she, with all her
unknown powers, she who is the sharer of his deepest secrets, who prepares
his very food day by day&mdash;what harm can she not, may she not, do?&nbsp;
And that she has good reason to turn against him, he knows too well.&nbsp;
What deliverance is there from this mysterious house-fiend, save brute
force?&nbsp; Terror, torture, murder, must be the order of the day.&nbsp;
Woman must be crushed, at all price, by the blind fear of the man.</p>
<p>I shall say no more.&nbsp; I shall draw a veil, for very pity and
shame, over the most important and most significant facts of this, the
most hideous of all human follies.&nbsp; I have, I think, given you
hints enough to show that it, like all other superstitions, is the child&mdash;the
last born and the ugliest child&mdash;of blind dread of the unknown.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SCIENCE <a name="citation229"></a><a href="#footnote229">{229}</a></h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I said, that Superstition was the child of Fear, and Fear the child
of Ignorance; and you might expect me to say antithetically, that Science
was the child of Courage, and Courage the child of Knowledge.</p>
<p>But these genealogies&mdash;like most metaphors&mdash;do not fit
exactly, as you may see for yourselves.</p>
<p>If fear be the child of ignorance, ignorance is also the child of
fear; the two react on, and produce each other.&nbsp; The more men dread
Nature, the less they wish to know about her.&nbsp; Why pry into her
awful secrets?&nbsp; It is dangerous; perhaps impious.&nbsp; She says
to them, as in the Egyptian temple of old&mdash;&ldquo;I am Isis, and
my veil no mortal yet hath lifted.&rdquo;&nbsp; And why should they
try or wish to lift it?&nbsp; If she will leave them in peace, they
will leave her in peace.&nbsp; It is enough that she does not destroy
them.&nbsp; So as ignorance bred fear, fear breeds fresh and willing
ignorance.</p>
<p>And courage?&nbsp; We may say, and truly, that courage is the child
of knowledge.&nbsp; But we may say as truly, that knowledge is the child
of courage.&nbsp; Those Egyptian priests in the temple of Isis would
have told you that knowledge was the child of mystery, of special illumination,
of reverence, and what not; hiding under grand words their purpose of
keeping the masses ignorant, that they might be their slaves.&nbsp;
Reverence?&nbsp; I will yield to none in reverence for reverence.&nbsp;
I will all but agree with the wise man who said that reverence is the
root of all virtues.&nbsp; But which child reverences his father most?&nbsp;
He who comes joyfully and trustfully to meet him, that he may learn
his father&rsquo;s mind, and do his will; or he who at his father&rsquo;s
coming runs away and hides, lest he should be beaten for he knows not
what?&nbsp; There is a scientific reverence, a reverence of courage,
which is surely one of the highest forms of reverence.&nbsp; That, namely,
which so reveres every fact, that it dare not overlook or falsify it,
seem it never so minute; which feels that because it is a fact it cannot
be minute, cannot be unimportant; that it must be a fact of God; a message
from God; a voice of God, as Bacon has it, revealed in things; and which
therefore, just because it stands in solemn awe of such paltry facts
as the Scolopax feather in a snipe&rsquo;s pinion, or the jagged leaves
which appear capriciously in certain honeysuckles, believes that there
is likely to be some deep and wide secret underlying them, which is
worth years of thought to solve.&nbsp; That is reverence; a reverence
which is growing, thank God, more and more common; which will produce,
as it grows more common still, fruit which generations yet unborn shall
bless.</p>
<p>But as for that other reverence, which shuts its eyes and ears in
pious awe&mdash;what is it but cowardice decked out in state robes,
putting on the sacred Urim and Thummim, not that men may ask counsel
of the Deity, but that they may not?&nbsp; What is it but cowardice,
very pitiable when unmasked; and what is its child but ignorance as
pitiable, which would be ludicrous were it not so injurious?&nbsp; If
a man comes up to Nature as to a parrot or a monkey, with this prevailing
thought in his head&mdash;Will it bite me?&mdash;will he not be pretty
certain to make up his mind that it may bite him, and had therefore
best be left alone?&nbsp; It is only the man of courage&mdash;few and
far between&mdash;who will stand the chance of a first bite, in the
hope of teaching the parrot to talk, or the monkey to fire off a gun.&nbsp;
And it is only the man of courage&mdash;few and far between&mdash;who
will stand the chance of a first bite from Nature, which may kill him
for aught he knows&mdash;for her teeth, though clumsy, are very strong&mdash;in
order that he may tame her and break her in to his use by the very same
method by which that admirable inductive philosopher, Mr. Rarey, used
to break in his horses; first, by not being afraid of them; and next,
by trying to find out what they were thinking of.&nbsp; But after all,
as with animals, so with Nature; cowardice is dangerous.&nbsp; The surest
method of getting bitten by an animal is to be afraid of it; and the
surest method of being injured by Nature is to be afraid of it.&nbsp;
Only as far as we understand Nature are we safe from it; and those who
in any age counsel mankind not to pry into the secrets of the universe,
counsel them not to provide for their own life and well-being, or for
their children after them.</p>
<p>But how few there have been in any age who have not been afraid of
Nature.&nbsp; How few have set themselves, like Rarey, to tame her by
finding out what she is thinking of.&nbsp; The mass are glad to have
the results of science, as they are to buy Mr. Rarey&rsquo;s horses
after they are tamed; but for want of courage or of wit, they had rather
leave the taming process to someone else.&nbsp; And therefore we may
say that what knowledge of Nature we have&mdash;and we have very little&mdash;we
owe to the courage of those men&mdash;and they have been very few&mdash;who
have been inspired to face Nature boldly; and say&mdash;or, what is
better, act as if they were saying&mdash;&ldquo;I find something in
me which I do not find in you; which gives me the hope that I can grow
to understand you, though you may not understand me; that I may become
your master, and not as now, you mine.&nbsp; And if not, I will know;
or die in the search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is to those men, the few and far between, in a very few ages and
very few countries, who have thus risen in rebellion against Nature,
and looked it in the face with an unquailing glance, that we owe what
we call Physical Science.</p>
<p>There have been four races&mdash;or rather a very few men of each
four races&mdash;who have faced Nature after this gallant wise.</p>
<p>First, the old Jews.&nbsp; I speak of them, be it remembered, exclusively
from an historical, and not a religious point of view.</p>
<p>These people, at a very remote epoch, emerged from a country highly
civilised, but sunk in the superstitions of nature-worship.&nbsp; They
invaded and mingled with tribes whose superstitions were even more debased,
silly, and foul than those of the Egyptians from whom they escaped.&nbsp;
Their own masses were for centuries given up to nature-worship.&nbsp;
Now, among those Jews arose men&mdash;a very few&mdash;sages&mdash;prophets&mdash;call
them what you will, the men were inspired heroes and philosophers&mdash;who
assumed towards nature an attitude utterly different from the rest of
their countrymen and the rest of the then world; who denounced superstition
and the dread of nature as the parent of all manner of vice and misery;
who for themselves said boldly that they discerned in the universe an
order, a unity, a permanence of law, which gave them courage instead
of fear.&nbsp; They found delight and not dread in the thought that
the universe obeyed a law which could not be broken; that all things
continued to that day according to a certain ordinance.&nbsp; They took
a view of Nature totally new in that age; healthy, human, cheerful,
loving, trustful, and yet reverent&mdash;identical with that which happily
is beginning to prevail in our own day.&nbsp; They defied those very
volcanic and meteoric phenomena of their land, to which their countrymen
were slaying their own children in the clefts of the rocks, and, like
Theophrastus&rsquo;s superstitious man, pouring their drink-offerings
on the smooth stones of the valley; and declared that, for their part,
they would not fear, though the earth was moved, and though the hills
were carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters raged and
swelled, and the mountains shook at the tempest.</p>
<p>The fact is indisputable.&nbsp; And you must pardon me if I express
my belief that these men, if they had felt it their business to found
a school of inductive physical science, would, owing to that temper
of mind, have achieved a very signal success.&nbsp; I ground that opinion
on the remarkable, but equally indisputable fact, that no nation has
ever succeeded in perpetuating a school of inductive physical science,
save those whose minds have been saturated with this same view of Nature,
which they have&mdash;as an historic fact&mdash;slowly but thoroughly
learnt from the writings of these Jewish sages.</p>
<p>Such is the fact.&nbsp; The founders of inductive physical science
were not the Jews; but first the Chald&aelig;ans, next the Greeks, next
their pupils the Romans&mdash;or rather a few sages among each race.&nbsp;
But what success had they?&nbsp; The Chald&aelig;an astronomers made
a few discoveries concerning the motions of the heavenly bodies, which,
rudimentary as they were, still prove them to have been men of rare
intellect.&nbsp; For a great and a patient genius must he have been,
who first distinguished the planets from the fixed stars, or worked
out the earliest astronomical calculation.&nbsp; But they seem to have
been crushed, as it were, by their own discoveries.&nbsp; They stopped
short.&nbsp; They gave way again to the primeval fear of Nature.&nbsp;
They sank into planet-worship.&nbsp; They invented, it would seem, that
fantastic pseudo-science of astrology, which lay for ages after as an
incubus on the human intellect and conscience.&nbsp; They became the
magicians and quacks of the old world; and mankind owed them thenceforth
nothing but evil.&nbsp; Among the Greeks and Romans, again, those sages
who dared face Nature like reasonable men, were accused by the superstitious
mob as irreverent impious atheists.&nbsp; The wisest of them all, Socrates,
was actually put to death on that charge; and finally, they failed.&nbsp;
School after school, in Greece and Rome, struggled to discover, and
to get a hearing for, some theory of the universe which was founded
on something like experience, reason, common sense.&nbsp; They were
not allowed to prosecute their attempt.&nbsp; The mud-ocean of ignorance
and fear in which they struggled so manfully was too strong for them;
the mud-waves closed over their heads finally, as the age of the Antonines
expired; and the last effort of Gr&aelig;co-Roman thought to explain
the universe was Neoplatonism&mdash;the muddiest of the muddy&mdash;an
attempt to apologise for, and organise into a system, all the nature-dreading
superstitions of the Roman world.&nbsp; Porphyry, Plotinus, Proclus,
poor Hypatia herself, and all her school&mdash;they may have had themselves
no bodily fear of Nature; for they were noble souls.&nbsp; Yet they
spent their time in justifying those who had; in apologising for the
superstitions of the very mob which they despised: just as&mdash;it
sometimes seems to me&mdash;some folk in these days are like to end
in doing; begging that the masses might be allowed to believe in anything,
however false, lest they should believe in nothing at all: as if believing
in lies could do anything but harm to any human being.&nbsp; And so
died the science of the old world, in a true second childhood, just
where it began.</p>
<p>The Jewish sages, I hold, taught that science was probable; the Greeks
and Romans proved that it was possible.&nbsp; It remained for our race,
under the teaching of both, to bring science into act and fact.</p>
<p>Many causes contributed to give them this power.&nbsp; They were
a personally courageous race.&nbsp; This earth has yet seen no braver
men than the forefathers of Christian Europe, whether Scandinavian or
Teuton, Angle or Frank.&nbsp; They were a practical hard-headed race,
with a strong appreciation of facts, and a strong determination to act
on them.&nbsp; Their laws, their society, their commerce, their colonisation,
their migrations by land and sea, proved that they were such.&nbsp;
They were favoured, moreover, by circumstances, or&mdash;as I should
rather put it&mdash;by that divine Providence which determined their
times, and the bounds of their habitation.&nbsp; They came in as the
heritors of the decaying civilisation of Greece and Rome; they colonised
territories which gave to man special fair play, but no more, in the
struggle for existence, the battle with the powers of Nature; tolerably
fertile, tolerably temperate; with boundless means of water communication;
freer than most parts of the world from those terrible natural phenomena,
like the earthquake and the hurricane, before which man lies helpless
and astounded, a child beneath the foot of a giant.&nbsp; Nature was
to them not so inhospitable as to starve their brains and limbs, as
it has done for the Esquimaux or Fuegian; and not so bountiful as to
crush them by its very luxuriance, as it has crushed the savages of
the tropics.&nbsp; They saw enough of its strength to respect it; not
enough to cower before it: and they and it have fought it out; and it
seems to me, standing either on London Bridge or on a Holland fen-dyke,
that they are winning at last.</p>
<p>But they had a sore battle: a battle against their own fear of the
unseen.&nbsp; They brought with them, out of the heart of Asia, dark
and sad nature-superstitions, some of which linger among our peasantry
till this day, of elves, trolls, nixes, and what not.&nbsp; Their Thor
and Odin were at first, probably, only the thunder and the wind: but
they had to be appeased in the dark marches of the forest, where hung
rotting on the sacred oaks, amid carcases of goat and horse, the carcases
of human victims.&nbsp; No one acquainted with the early legends and
ballads of our race, but must perceive throughout them all the prevailing
tone of fear and sadness.&nbsp; And to their own superstitions they
added those of the Rome which they conquered.&nbsp; They dreaded the
Roman she-poisoners and witches, who, like Horace&rsquo;s Canidia, still
performed horrid rites in graveyards and dark places of the earth.&nbsp;
They dreaded as magical the delicate images engraved on old Greek gems.&nbsp;
They dreaded the very Roman cities they had destroyed.&nbsp; They were
the work of enchanters.&nbsp; Like the ruins of St. Albans here in England,
they were all full of devils, guarding the treasures which the Romans
had hidden.&nbsp; The C&aelig;sars became to them magical man-gods.&nbsp;
The poet Virgil became the prince of necromancers.&nbsp; If the secrets
of Nature were to be known, they were to be known by unlawful means,
by prying into the mysteries of the old heathen magicians, or of the
Mohammedan doctors of Cordova and Seville; and those who dared to do
so were respected and feared, and often came to evil ends.&nbsp; It
needed moral courage, then, to face and interpret fact.&nbsp; Such brave
men as Pope Gerbert, Roger Bacon, Galileo, even Kepler, did not lead
happy lives; some of them found themselves in prison.&nbsp; All the
medieval sages&mdash;even Albertus Magnus&mdash;were stigmatised as
magicians.&nbsp; One wonders that more of them did not imitate poor
Paracelsus, who, unable to get a hearing for his coarse common sense,
took&mdash;vain and sensual&mdash;to drinking the laudanum which he
himself had discovered, and vaunted as a priceless boon to men; and
died as the fool dieth, in spite of all his wisdom.&nbsp; For the &ldquo;Romani
nominis umbra,&rdquo; the shadow of the mighty race whom they had conquered,
lay heavy on our forefathers for centuries.&nbsp; And their dread of
the great heathens was really a dread of Nature, and of the powers thereof.&nbsp;
For when the authority of great names has reigned unquestioned for many
centuries, those names become, to the human mind, integral and necessary
parts of Nature itself.&nbsp; They are, as it were, absorbed into it;
they become its laws, its canons, its demiurges, and guardian spirits;
their words become regarded as actual facts; in one word, they become
a superstition, and are feared as parts of the vast unknown; and to
deny what they have said is, in the minds of the many, not merely to
fly in the face of reverent wisdom, but to fly in the face of facts.&nbsp;
During a great part of the Middle Ages, for instance, it was impossible
for an educated man to think of nature itself, without thinking first
of what Aristotle had said of her.&nbsp; Aristotle&rsquo;s dicta were
Nature; and when Benedetti, at Venice, opposed in 1585 Aristotle&rsquo;s
opinions on violent and natural motion, there were hundreds, perhaps,
in the universities of Europe&mdash;as there certainly were in the days
of the immortal &ldquo;Epistol&aelig; Obscurorum Virorum&rdquo;&mdash;who
were ready, in spite of all Benedetti&rsquo;s professed reverence for
Aristotle, to accuse him of outraging not only the father of philosophy,
but Nature itself and its palpable and notorious facts.&nbsp; For the
restoration of letters in the fifteenth century had not at first mended
matters, so strong was the dread of Nature in the minds of the masses.&nbsp;
The minds of men had sported forth, not toward any sound investigation
of facts, but toward an eclectic resuscitation of Neoplatonism; which
endured, not without a certain beauty and use&mdash;as let Spenser&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Fa&euml;rie Queen&rdquo; bear witness&mdash;till the latter half
of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>After that time a rapid change began.&nbsp; It is marked by&mdash;it
has been notably assisted by&mdash;the foundation of our own Royal Society.&nbsp;
Its causes I will not enter into; they are so inextricably mixed, I
hold, with theological questions, that they cannot be discussed here.&nbsp;
I will only point out to you these facts: that, from the latter part
of the seventeenth century, the noblest heads and the noblest hearts
of Europe concentrated themselves more and more on the brave and patient
investigation of physical facts, as the source of priceless future blessings
to mankind; that the eighteenth century which it has been the fashion
of late to depreciate, did more for the welfare of mankind, in every
conceivable direction, than the whole fifteen centuries before it; that
it did this good work by boldly observing and analysing facts; that
this boldness towards facts increased in proportion as Europe became
indoctrinated with the Jewish literature; and that, notably, such men
as Kepler, Newton, Berkeley, Spinoza, Leibnitz, Descartes, in whatsoever
else they differed, agreed in this, that their attitude towards Nature
was derived from the teaching of the Jewish sages.&nbsp; I believe that
we are not yet fully aware how much we owe to the Jewish mind, in the
gradual emancipation of the human intellect.&nbsp; The connection may
not, of course, be one of cause and effect; it may be a mere coincidence.&nbsp;
I believe it to be a cause; one of course of very many causes: but still
an integral cause.&nbsp; At least the coincidence is too remarkable
a fact not to be worthy of investigation.</p>
<p>I said, just now&mdash;The emancipation of the human intellect.&nbsp;
I did not say&mdash;Of science or of the scientific intellect; and for
this reason:</p>
<p>That the emancipation of science is the emancipation of the common
mind of all men.&nbsp; All men can partake of the gains of free scientific
thought, not merely by enjoying its physical results, but by becoming
more scientific men themselves.</p>
<p>Therefore it was, that though I began my first lecture by defining
superstition, I did not begin my second by defining its antagonist,
science.&nbsp; For the word &ldquo;science&rdquo; defines itself.&nbsp;
It means simply knowledge; that is, of course, right knowledge, or such
an approximation as can be obtained; knowledge of any natural object,
its classification, its causes, its effects; or in plain English, what
it is, how it came where it is, and what can be done with it.</p>
<p>And scientific method, likewise, needs no definition; for it is simply
the exercise of common sense.&nbsp; It is not a peculiar, unique, professional,
or mysterious process of the understanding: but the same which all men
employ, from the cradle to the grave, in forming correct conclusions.</p>
<p>Every one who knows the philosophic writings of Mr. John Stuart Mill,
will be familiar with this opinion.&nbsp; But to those who have no leisure
to study him, I should recommend the reading of Professor Huxley&rsquo;s
third lecture on the origin of species.</p>
<p>In that he shows, with great logical skill, as well as with some
humour, how the man who, on rising in the morning finds the parlour-window
open, the spoons and teapot gone, the mark of a dirty hand on the window-sill,
and that of a hob-nailed boot outside, and comes to the conclusion that
someone has broken open the window, and stolen the plate, arrives at
that hypothesis&mdash;for it is nothing more&mdash;by a long and complex
train of inductions and deductions of just the same kind as those which,
according to the Baconian philosophy, are to be used for investigating
the deepest secrets of Nature.</p>
<p>This is true, even of those sciences which involve long mathematical
calculations.&nbsp; In fact, the stating of the problem to be solved
is the most important element in the calculation; and that is so thoroughly
a labour of common sense that an utterly uneducated mart may, and often
does, state an abstruse problem clearly and correctly; seeing what ought
to be proved, and perhaps how to prove it, though he may be unable to
work the problem out for want of mathematical knowledge.</p>
<p>But that mathematical knowledge is not&mdash;as all Cambridge men
are surely aware&mdash;the result of any special gift.&nbsp; It is merely
the development of those conceptions of form and number which every
human being possesses; and any person of average intellect can make
himself a fair mathematician if he will only pay continuous attention;
in plain English, think enough about the subject.</p>
<p>There are sciences, again, which do not involve mathematical calculation;
for instance, botany, zoology, geology, which are just now passing from
their old stage of classificatory sciences into the rank of organic
ones.&nbsp; These are, without doubt, altogether within the scope of
the merest common sense.&nbsp; Any man or woman of average intellect,
if they will but observe and think for themselves, freely, boldly, patiently,
accurately, may judge for themselves of the conclusions of these sciences,
may add to these conclusions fresh and important discoveries; and if
I am asked for a proof of what I assert, I point to &ldquo;Rain and
Rivers,&rdquo; written by no professed scientific man, but by a colonel
in the Guards, known to fame only as one of the most perfect horsemen
in the world.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate my meaning by an example.&nbsp; A man&mdash;I do
not say a geologist, but simply a man, squire or ploughman&mdash;sees
a small valley, say one of the side-glens which open into the larger
valleys in the Windsor forest district.&nbsp; He wishes to ascertain
its age.</p>
<p>He has, at first sight, a very simple measure&mdash;that of denudation.&nbsp;
He sees that the glen is now being eaten out by a little stream, the
product of innumerable springs which arise along its sides, and which
are fed entirely by the rain on the moors above.&nbsp; He finds, on
observation, that this stream brings down some ten cubic yards of sand
and gravel, on an average, every year.&nbsp; The actual quantity of
earth which has been removed to make the glen may be several million
cubic yards.&nbsp; Here is an easy sum in arithmetic.&nbsp; At the rate
of ten cubic yards a-year, the stream has taken several hundred thousand
years to make the glen.</p>
<p>You will observe that this result is obtained by mere common sense.&nbsp;
He has a right to assume that the stream originally began the glen,
because he finds it in the act of enlarging it; just as much right as
he has to assume, if he find a hole in his pocket, and his last coin
in the act of falling through it, that the rest of his money has fallen
through the same hole.&nbsp; It is a sufficient cause, and the simplest.&nbsp;
A number of observations as to the present rate of denudation, and a
sum which any railroad contractor can do in his head, to determine the
solid contents of the valley, are all that are needed.&nbsp; The method
is that of science: but it is also that of simple common sense.&nbsp;
You will remember, therefore, that this is no mere theory or hypothesis,
but a pretty fair and simple conclusion from palpable facts; that the
probability lies with the belief that the glen is some hundreds of thousands
of years old; that it is not the observer&rsquo;s business to prove
it further, but other persons&rsquo; to disprove it, if they can.</p>
<p>But does the matter end here?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; And, for certain reasons,
it is good that it should not end here.</p>
<p>The observer, if he be a cautious man, begins to see if he can disprove
his own conclusions; moreover, being human, he is probably somewhat
awed, if not appalled, by his own conclusion.&nbsp; Hundreds of thousands
of years spent in making that little glen!&nbsp; Common sense would
say that the longer it took to make, the less wonder there was in its
being made at last: but the instinctive human feeling is the opposite.&nbsp;
There is in men, and there remains in them, even after they are civilised,
and all other forms of the dread of Nature have died out in them, a
dread of size, of vast space, of vast time; that latter, mind, being
always imagined as space, as we confess when we speak instinctively
of a space of time.&nbsp; They will not understand that size is merely
a relative, not an absolute term; that if we were a thousand times larger
than we are, the universe would be a thousand times smaller than it
is; that if we could think a thousand times faster than we do, time
would be a thousand times longer than it is; that there is One in whom
we live, and move, and have our being, to whom one day is as a thousand
years, and a thousand years as one day.&nbsp; I believe this dread of
size to be merely, like all other superstitions, a result of bodily
fear; a development of the instinct which makes a little dog run away
from a big dog.&nbsp; Be that as it may, every observer has it; and
so the man&rsquo;s conclusion seems to him strange, doubtful: he will
reconsider it.</p>
<p>Moreover, if he be an experienced man, he is well aware that first
guesses, first hypotheses, are not always the right ones; and if he
be a modest man, he will consider the fact that many thousands of thoughtful
men in all ages, and many thousands still, would say, that the glen
can only be a few thousand, or possibly a few hundred, years old.&nbsp;
And he will feel bound to consider their opinion; as far as it is, like
his own, drawn from facts, but no further.</p>
<p>So he casts about for all other methods by which the glen may have
been produced, to see if any one of them will account for it in a shorter
time.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Was it made by an earthquake?&nbsp; No; for the strata on
both sides are identical, at the same level, and in the same plane.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Or by a mighty current?&nbsp; If so, the flood must have
run in at the upper end, before it ran out at the lower.&nbsp; But nothing
has run in at the upper end.&nbsp; All round above are the undisturbed
gravel-beds of the horizontal moor, without channel or depression.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Or by water draining off a vast flat as it was upheaved
out of the sea?&nbsp; That is a likely guess.&nbsp; The valley at its
upper end spreads out like the fingers of a hand, as the gullies in
tide-muds do.</p>
<p>But that hypothesis will not stand.&nbsp; There is no vast unbroken
flat behind the glen.&nbsp; Right and left of it are other similar glens,
parted from it by long narrow ridges: these also must be explained on
the same hypothesis; but they cannot.&nbsp; For there could not have
been surface-drainage to make them all, or a tenth of them.&nbsp; There
are no other possible hypotheses; and so he must fall back on the original
theory&mdash;the rain, the springs, the brook; they have done it all,
even as they are doing it this day.</p>
<p>But is not that still a hasty assumption?&nbsp; May not their denuding
power have been far greater in old times than now?</p>
<p>Why should it?&nbsp; Because there was more rain then than now?&nbsp;
That he must put out of court; there is no evidence of it whatsoever.</p>
<p>Because the land was more friable originally?&nbsp; Well, there is
a great deal to be said for that.&nbsp; The experience of every countryman
tells him that bare or fallow land is more easily washed away than land
under vegetation.&nbsp; And no doubt, when these gravels and sands rose
from the sea, they were barren for hundreds of years.&nbsp; He has some
measure of the time required, because he can tell roughly how long it
takes for sands and shingles left by the sea to become covered with
vegetation.&nbsp; But he must allow that the friability of the land
must have been originally much greater than now, for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>But again, does that fact really cut off any great space of time
from his hundreds of thousands of years?&nbsp; For when the land first
rose from the sea, that glen was not there.&nbsp; Some slight bay or
bend in the shore determined its site.&nbsp; That stream was not there.&nbsp;
It was split up into a million little springs, oozing side by side from
the shore, and having each a very minute denuding power, which kept
continually increasing by combination as the glen ate its way inwards,
and the rainfall drained by all these little springs was collected into
the one central stream.&nbsp; So that when the ground being bare was
most liable to be denuded, the water was least able to do it; and as
the denuding power of the water increased, the land, being covered with
vegetation, became more and more able to resist it.&nbsp; All this he
has seen, going on at the present day in the similar gullies worn in
the soft strata of the South Hampshire coast; especially round Bournemouth.</p>
<p>So the two disturbing elements in the calculation may be fairly set
off against each other, as making a difference of only a few thousands
or tens of thousands of years either way; and the age of the glen may
fairly be, if not a million years, yet such a length of years as mankind
still speak of with bated breath, as if forsooth it would do them some
harm.</p>
<p>I trust that every scientific man in this room will agree with me,
that the imaginary squire or ploughman would have been conducting his
investigation strictly according to the laws of the Baconian philosophy.&nbsp;
You will remark, meanwhile, that he has not used a single scientific
term, or referred to a single scientific investigation; and has observed
nothing and thought nothing, which might not have been observed and
thought by any one who chose to use his common sense, and not to be
afraid.</p>
<p>But because he has come round, after all this further investigation,
to something very like his first conclusion, was all that further investigation
useless?&nbsp; No&mdash;a thousand times, no.&nbsp; It is this very
verification of hypotheses which makes the sound ones safe, and destroys
the unsound.&nbsp; It is this struggle with all sorts of superstitions
which makes science strong and sure, and her march irresistible, winning
ground slowly, but never receding from it.&nbsp; It is this buffeting
of adversity which compels her not to rest dangerously upon the shallow
sand of first guesses, and single observations; but to strike her roots
down, deep, wide, and interlaced, into the solid ground of actual facts.</p>
<p>It is very necessary to insist on this point.&nbsp; For there have
been men in all past ages&mdash;I do not say whether there are any such
now, but I am inclined to think that there will be hereafter&mdash;men
who have tried to represent scientific method as something difficult,
mysterious, peculiar, unique, not to be attained by the unscientific
mass; and this not for the purpose of exalting science, but rather of
discrediting her.&nbsp; For as long as the masses, educated or uneducated,
are ignorant of what scientific method is, they will look on scientific
men, as the middle age looked on necromancers, as a privileged, but
awful and uncanny caste, possessed of mighty secrets; who may do them
great good, but may also do them great harm.&nbsp; Which belief on the
part of the masses will enable these persons to instal themselves as
the critics of science, though not scientific men themselves: and&mdash;as
Shakespeare has it&mdash;to talk of Robin Hood, though they never shot
in his bow.&nbsp; Thus they become mediators to the masses between the
scientific and the unscientific worlds.&nbsp; They tell them&mdash;You
are not to trust the conclusions of men of science at first hand.&nbsp;
You are not fit judges of their facts or of their methods.&nbsp; It
is we who will, by a cautious eclecticism, choose out for you such of
their conclusions as are safe for you; and them we will advise you to
believe.&nbsp; To the scientific man, on the other hand, as often as
anything is discovered unpleasing to them, they will say, imperiously
and e cathedr&acirc;&mdash;Your new theory contradicts the established
facts of science.&nbsp; For they will know well that whatever the men
of science think of their assertion, the masses will believe it; totally
unaware that the speakers are by their very terms showing their ignorance
of science; and that what they call established facts scientific men
call merely provisional conclusions, which they would throw away to-morrow
without a pang were the known facts explained better by a fresh theory,
or did fresh facts require one.</p>
<p>This has happened too often.&nbsp; It is in the interest of superstition
that it should happen again; and the best way to prevent it surely is
to tell the masses&mdash;Scientific method is no peculiar mystery, requiring
a peculiar initiation.&nbsp; It is simply common sense, combined with
uncommon courage, which includes uncommon honesty and uncommon patience;
and if you will be brave, honest, patient, and rational, you will need
no mystagogues to tell you what in science to believe and what not to
believe; for you will be just as good judges of scientific facts and
theories as those who assume the right of guiding your convictions.&nbsp;
You are men and women: and more than that you need not be.</p>
<p>And let me say that the man of our days whose writings exemplify
most thoroughly what I am going to say is the justly revered Mr. Thomas
Carlyle.</p>
<p>As far as I know he has never written on any scientific subject.&nbsp;
For aught I am aware of, he may know nothing of mathematics or chemistry,
of comparative anatomy or geology.&nbsp; For aught I am aware of, he
may know a great deal about them all, and, like a wise man, hold his
tongue, and give the world merely the results in the form of general
thought.&nbsp; But this I know: that his writings are instinct with
the very spirit of science; that he has taught men, more than any living
man, the meaning and end of science; that he has taught men moral and
intellectual courage; to face facts boldly, while they confess the divineness
of facts; not to be afraid of Nature, and not to worship Nature; to
believe that man can know truth; and that only in as far as he knows
truth can he live worthily on this earth.&nbsp; And thus he has vindicated,
as no other man in our days has done, at once the dignity of Nature
and the dignity of spirit.&nbsp; That he would have made a distinguished
scientific man, we may be as certain from his writings as we may be
certain, when we see a fine old horse of a certain stamp, that he would
have made a first-class hunter, though he has been unfortunately all
his life in harness.&nbsp; Therefore, did I try to train a young man
of science to be true, devout, and earnest, accurate and daring, I should
say&mdash;Read what you will: but at least read Carlyle.&nbsp; It is
a small matter to me&mdash;and I doubt not to him&mdash;whether you
will agree with his special conclusions: but his premises and his method
are irrefragable; for they stand on the &ldquo;voluntatem Dei in rebus
revelatam&rdquo;&mdash;on fact and common sense.</p>
<p>And Mr. Carlyle&rsquo;s writings, if I am correct in my estimate
of them, will afford a very sufficient answer to those who think that
the scientific habit of mind tends to irreverence.</p>
<p>Doubtless this accusation will always be brought against science
by those who confound reverence with fear.&nbsp; For from blind fear
of the unknown, science does certainly deliver man.&nbsp; She does by
man as he does by an unbroken colt.&nbsp; The colt sees by the road
side some quite new object&mdash;a cast-away boot, an old kettle, or
what not.&nbsp; What a fearful monster!&nbsp; What unknown terrific
powers may it not possess!&nbsp; And the colt shies across the road,
runs up the bank, rears on end; putting itself thereby, as many a man
does, in real danger.&nbsp; What cure is there?&nbsp; But one: experience.&nbsp;
So science takes us, as we should take the colt, gently by the halter;
and makes us simply smell at the new monster; till after a few trembling
sniffs, we discover, like the colt, that it is not a monster, but a
kettle.&nbsp; Yet I think, if we sum up the loss and gain, we shall
find the colt&rsquo;s character has gained, rather than lost, by being
thus disabused.&nbsp; He learns to substitute a very rational reverence
for the man who is breaking him in, for a totally irrational reverence
for the kettle; and becomes thereby a much wiser and more useful member
of society, as does the man when disabused of his superstitions.</p>
<p>From which follows one result.&nbsp; That if science proposes&mdash;as
she does&mdash;to make men brave, wise, and independent, she must needs
excite unpleasant feelings in all who desire to keep men cowardly, ignorant,
and slavish.&nbsp; And that too many such persons have existed in all
ages is but too notorious.&nbsp; There have been from all time, go&euml;tai,
quacks, powwow men, rain-makers, and necromancers of various sorts,
who having for their own purposes set forth partial, ill-grounded, fantastic,
and frightful interpretations of nature, have no love for those who
search after a true, exact, brave, and hopeful one.&nbsp; And therefore
it is to be feared, or hoped, that science and superstition will to
the world&rsquo;s end remain irreconcilable and internecine foes.</p>
<p>Conceive the feelings of an old Lapland witch, who has had for the
last fifty years all the winds in a sealskin bag, and has been selling
fair breezes to northern skippers at so much a puff, asserting her powers
so often, poor old soul, that she has got to half believe them herself&mdash;conceive,
I say, her feelings at seeing her customers watch the Admiralty storm-signals,
and con the weather reports in <i>The Times</i>.&nbsp; Conceive the
feelings of Sir Samuel Baker&rsquo;s African friend, Katchiba, the rain-making
chief, who possessed a whole houseful of thunder and lightning&mdash;though
he did not, he confessed, keep it in a bottle as they do in England&mdash;if
Sir Samuel had had the means, and the will, of giving to Katchiba&rsquo;s
Negros a course of lectures on electricity, with appropriate experiments,
and a real bottle full of real lightning among the foremost.</p>
<p>It is clear that only two methods of self-defence would have been
open to the rain-maker: namely, either to kill Sir Samuel, or to buy
his real secret of bottling the lightning, that he might use it for
his own ends.&nbsp; The former method&mdash;that of killing the man
of science&mdash;was found more easy in ancient times; the latter in
these modern ones.&nbsp; And there have been always those who, too good-natured
to kill the scientific man, have patronised knowledge, not for its own
sake, but for the use which may be made of it; who would like to keep
a tame man of science, as they would a tame poet, or a tame parrot;
who say&mdash;Let us have science by all means, but not too much of
it.&nbsp; It is a dangerous thing; to be doled out to the world, like
medicine, in small and cautious doses.&nbsp; You, the scientific man,
will of course freely discover what you choose.&nbsp; Only do not talk
too loudly about it: leave that to us.&nbsp; We understand the world,
and are meant to guide and govern it.&nbsp; So discover freely: and
meanwhile hand over your discoveries to us, that we may instruct and
edify the populace with so much of them as we think safe, while we keep
our position thereby, and in many cases make much money by your science.&nbsp;
Do that, and we will patronise you, applaud you, ask you to our houses;
and you shall be clothed in purple and fine linen, and fare sumptuously
with us every day.&nbsp; I know not whether these latter are not the
worst enemies which science has.&nbsp; They are often such excellent,
respectable, orderly, well-meaning persons.&nbsp; They desire so sincerely
that everyone should be wise: only not too wise.&nbsp; They are so utterly
unaware of the mischief they are doing.&nbsp; They would recoil with
horror if they were told they were so many Iscariots, betraying Truth
with a kiss.</p>
<p>But science, as yet, has withstood both terrors and blandishments.&nbsp;
In old times she endured being imprisoned and slain.&nbsp; She came
to life again.&nbsp; Perhaps it was the will of Him in whom all things
live, that she should live.&nbsp; Perhaps it was His spirit which gave
her life.</p>
<p>She can endure, too, being starved.&nbsp; Her votaries have not as
yet cared much for purple and fine linen, and sumptuous fare.&nbsp;
There are a very few among them who, joining brilliant talents to solid
learning, have risen to deserved popularity, to titles, and to wealth.&nbsp;
But even their labours, it seems to me, are never rewarded in any proportion
to the time and the intellect spent on them, nor to the benefits which
they bring to mankind; while the great majority, unpaid and unknown,
toil on, and have to find in science her own reward.&nbsp; Better, perhaps,
that it should be so.&nbsp; Better for science that she should be free,
in holy poverty, to go where she will and say what she knows, than that
she should be hired out at so much a year to say things pleasing to
the many, and to those who guide the many.&nbsp; And so, I verily believe,
the majority of scientific men think.&nbsp; There are those among them
who have obeyed very faithfully St. Paul&rsquo;s precept: &ldquo;No
man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
For they have discovered that they are engaged in a war&mdash;a veritable
war&mdash;against the rulers of darkness, against ignorance and its
twin children, fear and cruelty.&nbsp; Of that war they see neither
the end nor even the plan.&nbsp; But they are ready to go on; ready,
with Socrates, &ldquo;to follow reason whithersoever it leads;&rdquo;
and content, meanwhile, like good soldiers in a campaign, if they can
keep tolerably in a line, and use their weapons, and see a few yards
ahead of them through the smoke and the woods.&nbsp; They will come
out somewhere at last; they know not where nor when: but they will come
out at last, into the daylight and the open field; and be told then&mdash;perhaps
to their own astonishment&mdash;as many a gallant soldier has been told,
that by simply walking straight on, and doing the duty which lay nearest
them, they have helped to win a great battle, and slay great giants,
earning the thanks of their country and of mankind.</p>
<p>And, meanwhile, if they get their shilling a-day of fighting-pay,
they are content.&nbsp; I had almost said, they ought to be content.&nbsp;
For science is, I verily believe, like virtue, its own exceeding great
reward.&nbsp; I can conceive few human states more enviable than that
of the man to whom, panting in the foul laboratory, or watching for
his life under the tropic forest, Isis shall for a moment lift her sacred
veil, and show him, once and for ever, the thing he dreamed not of;
some law, or even mere hint of a law, explaining one fact; but explaining
with it a thousand more, connecting them all with each other and with
the mighty whole, till order and meaning shoots through some old Chaos
of scattered observations.</p>
<p>Is not that a joy, a prize, which wealth cannot give, nor poverty
take away?&nbsp; What it may lead to, he knows not.&nbsp; Of what use
it may become, he knows not.&nbsp; But this he knows, that somewhere
it must lead; of some use it will be.&nbsp; For it is a truth; and having
found a truth, he has exorcised one more of the ghosts which haunt humanity.&nbsp;
He has left one object less for man to fear; one object more for man
to use.&nbsp; Yes, the scientific man may have this comfort, that whatever
he has done, he has done good; that he is following a mistress who has
never yet conferred aught but benefits on the human race.</p>
<p>What physical science may do hereafter I know not; but as yet she
has done this:</p>
<p>She has enormously increased the wealth of the human race; and has
therefore given employment, food, existence, to millions who, without
science, would either have starved or have never been born.&nbsp; She
has shown that the dictum of the early political economists, that population
has a tendency to increase faster than the means of subsistence, is
no law of humanity, but merely a tendency of the barbaric and ignorant
man, which can be counteracted by increasing manifold by scientific
means his powers of producing food.&nbsp; She has taught men, during
the last few years, to foresee and elude the most destructive storms;
and there is no reason for doubting, and many reasons for hoping, that
she will gradually teach men to elude other terrific forces of nature,
too powerful and too seemingly capricious for them to conquer.&nbsp;
She has discovered innumerable remedies and alleviations for pains and
disease.&nbsp; She has thrown such light on the causes of epidemics,
that we are able to say now that the presence of cholera&mdash;and probably
of all zymotic diseases&mdash;in any place, is usually a sin and a shame,
for which the owners and authorities of that place ought to be punishable
by law, as destroyers of their fellow-men; while for the weak, for those
who, in the barbarous and semi-barbarous state&mdash;and out of that
last we are only just emerging&mdash;how much has she done; an earnest
of much more which she will do?&nbsp; She has delivered the insane&mdash;I
may say by the scientific insight of one man, more worthy of titles
and pensions than nine-tenths of those who earn them&mdash;I mean the
great and good Pinel&mdash;from hopeless misery and torture into comparative
peace and comfort, and at least the possibility of cure.&nbsp; For children,
she has done much, or rather might do, would parents read and perpend
such books as Andrew Combe&rsquo;s and those of other writers on physical
education.&nbsp; We should not then see the children, even of the rich,
done to death piecemeal by improper food, improper clothes, neglect
of ventilation and the commonest measures for preserving health.&nbsp;
We should not see their intellects stunted by Procrustean attempts to
teach them all the same accomplishments, to the neglect, most often,
of any sound practical training of their faculties.&nbsp; We should
not see slight indigestion, or temporary rushes of blood to the head,
condemned and punished as sins against Him who took up little children
in His arms and blessed them.</p>
<p>But we may have hope.&nbsp; When we compare education now with what
it was even forty years ago, much more with the stupid brutality of
the monastic system, we may hail for children, as well as for grown
people, the advent of the reign of common sense.</p>
<p>And for woman&mdash;What might I not say on that point?&nbsp; But
most of it would be fitly discussed only among physicians and biologists:
here I will say only this: Science has exterminated, at least among
civilised nations, witch-manias.&nbsp; Women&mdash;at least white women&mdash;are
no longer tortured or burnt alive from man&rsquo;s blind fear of the
unknown.&nbsp; If science had done no more than that, she would deserve
the perpetual thanks and the perpetual trust, not only of the women
whom she has preserved from agony, but the men whom she has preserved
from crime.</p>
<p>These benefits have already accrued to civilised men, because they
have lately allowed a very few of their number peaceably to imitate
Mr. Rarey, and find out what nature&mdash;or rather, to speak at once
reverently and accurately, He who made nature&mdash;is thinking of,
and obey the &ldquo;voluntatem Dei in rebus revelatam.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This science has done, while yet in her infancy.&nbsp; What she will
do in her maturity, who dare predict?&nbsp; At least, in the face of
such facts as these, those who bid us fear, or restrain, or mutilate
science, bid us commit an act of folly, as well as of ingratitude, which
can only harm ourselves.&nbsp; For science has as yet done nothing but
good.&nbsp; Will any one tell me what harm it has ever done?&nbsp; When
any one will show me a single result of science, of the knowledge of
and use of physical facts, which has not tended directly to the benefit
of mankind, moral and spiritual, as well as physical and economic&mdash;then
I shall be tempted to believe that Solomon was wrong when he said that
the one thing to be sought after on earth, more precious than all treasure,
she who has length of days in her right hand, and in her left hand riches
and honour, whose ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are
peace, who is a tree of life to all who lay hold on her, and makes happy
every one who retains her, is&mdash;as you will see if you will yourselves
consult the passage&mdash;that very Wisdom&mdash;by which God has founded
the earth; and that very Understanding&mdash;by which He has established
the heavens.</p>

<h2>THOUGHTS IN A GRAVEL-PIT <a name="citation262"></a><a href="#footnote262">{262}</a></h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we may of course think of anything which we
choose in a gravel-pit, as we may anywhere else.&nbsp; Thought is free:
at least so we fancy.</p>
<p>But the most right sort of thought, after all, is thought about what
lies nearest us; not always, but surely once in a way, that we may understand
something of everyday objects.&nbsp; And therefore it may be well worth
our while to go once into a gravel-pit, and think about it, till we
have learnt what a gravel-pit is.</p>
<p>Learnt what a gravel-pit is?&nbsp; Everybody knows.</p>
<p>If it be so, everybody knows more than I know.&nbsp; We all know
a gravel-pit when we see one; but we do not all know what we see.&nbsp;
I do not know.&nbsp; I know a little; a few scraps of fact about these
pits round here, though about no others.&nbsp; Were I to go into a pit
a hundred miles, even fifty miles off, I could tell you nothing certain
about it; perhaps might make a dozen mistakes.&nbsp; But what I know,
with tolerable certainty, about the pits round here, I wish to tell
you to-night.</p>
<p>But why?&nbsp; You do not need, one in ten of you, to know anything
about gravel, unless you be highway surveyor, or have a garden-walk
to make; and then someone will easily tell you where the best gravel
is to be got, at so much a load.</p>
<p>Very true; but you come here to-night to instruct yourselves; that
is, to learn, if you can, something more about the world you live in;
something more about God who made the world.</p>
<p>And you come here to educate yourselves; to educe and bring out your
own powers of perceiving, judging, reasoning; to improve yourselves
in the art of all arts, which is, the art of learning.&nbsp; That is
mental education.</p>
<p>Now if a gravel-pit will teach you a little about these things, you
will surely call it a rich gravel-pit.&nbsp; If it helps you to wisdom,
which is worth more than gold; which is the only way to get gold wisely,
and spend it wisely; then we will call our pit no more a gravel-pit,
but a wisdom-pit, a mine of wisdom.</p>
<p>Let us go out, then, in fancy (for it is too cold to go out in person)
to Hook Common, scramble down into the first gravel-pit we come to,
and see what we can see.</p>
<p>The first thing we see is a quantity of stones, more or less rounded,
lying in gravel and poor clay.</p>
<p>Well&mdash;what do those stones tell us?</p>
<p>These stones, as I told you when I addressed you last, are ancient
and venerable worthies.&nbsp; They have seen a great deal in their time.&nbsp;
They have had a great deal of knocking about, and have stood it manfully.&nbsp;
They have stood the knocking about of three worlds already; and have
done their duty therein; and they are ready (if you choose to mend the
road with them) to stand the knocking about of this fourth world, and
being most excellent gravel, to do their duty in this world likewise;
which is more, I fear, than either you or I can say for ourselves.</p>
<p>Three worlds?</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Standing there in the gravel-pit, I see three old worlds,
in each of which these stones played their part; and this world of man
for the fourth, and the best of all&mdash;for man if not for the stones.&nbsp;
I speak sober truth.&nbsp; Let me explain it step by step.</p>
<p>You know the chalk-hills to the south; and the sands of Crooksbury
and the Hind Head beyond them.&nbsp; There is one world.</p>
<p>You know the clays and sands of Hook and Newnham, Dogmersfield and
Shapley Heath, and all the country to the north as far as Reading.&nbsp;
There is a second world.</p>
<p>You know the gravel-pit itself; and all the upper soils and gravels,
which are spread over the length and breadth of the country to the north.&nbsp;
There is a third world.</p>
<p>Let us take them one by one.</p>
<p>First, the chalk.</p>
<p>The chalk-hills rise much higher than the surrounding country; but
you must not therefore suppose that they were made after it, and laid
on the top of it.&nbsp; That guess would be true, if you went south-east
from here toward the Hind Head.&nbsp; The chalk lies on the top of the
sands of Crooksbury Hill, and the clays of Holt Forest; but it dips
underneath the sands of Shapley Heath, and the clays of Dogmersfield,
and reappears from underneath them again at Reading.</p>
<p>Thus you at Odiham stand on the edge of a chalk basin; of what was
once a sea, or estuary, with shores of chalk, which begins at the foot
of the High Clere Hills, and runs eastward, widening as it goes, past
London, into the Eastern Sea.&nbsp; Everywhere under this great basin
is the floor of chalk, covered with clays and sands, which, for certain
reasons, are called by geologists Tertiary strata.</p>
<p>But what has this to do with a gravel-pit?</p>
<p>This first.&nbsp; That all the flints in this pit have come out of
the chalk.&nbsp; They are coloured, most of them, with iron, which has
turned them brown; but they are exactly the same flints as those gray
ones in the chalk-pit on the other side of the town.</p>
<p>How do I know that?</p>
<p>I think our own eyes will prove it: they are the same shapes, and
of the same substance; but as a still surer proof, we find exactly the
same fossils in them; sponges, choanites (which were something like
our modern sea-anemones), corals, and &ldquo;shepherds&rsquo; crowns&rdquo;
as the boys call the fossil sea-urchins.&nbsp; The species of all these,
and of other fossils, in the chalk-pit and in the gravel-pit, are absolutely
identical.&nbsp; The natural conclusion is, then, that the gravel has
been formed from the washings of the chalk.&nbsp; The white lime of
the chalk has been carried away in water by some flood or floods; the
heavier flints have been left behind.</p>
<p>Stop now one moment, and think.&nbsp; You all know how very few flints
there are in the chalk-pit, in proportion to the mass of chalk.&nbsp;
You all know what vast gravel-beds cover the country to the north, and
often to the thickness of many feet.&nbsp; Try and conceive, then, what
a much more vast mass of chalk must have been washed away, to leave
that vast mass of gravel behind it.&mdash;Conceive?&nbsp; It is past
conception.&nbsp; I will but give you two hints as to its probable size.</p>
<p>The chalk to the eastward, between here and Farnham, is a far narrower
and shallower band than anywhere else in England.&nbsp; Its narrowest
point is, I believe, beneath the bishop&rsquo;s palace at Farnham, where
it may be a hundred feet thick, instead of several hundred, as it usually
is in other parts of England.&nbsp; The cause of this is, that the whole
of the upper chalk has been washed away, to form the gravel-beds to
the north and east of us.</p>
<p>Again.&nbsp; Some of you may have been on the Hind Head or on Leith
Hill, and have looked southward over the glorious prospect of the rich
Weald, spread out five hundred feet below&mdash;a sight to make an Englishman
proud of his native land.&nbsp; Now, the mass of chalk which has been
carried away began behind you, at the Hogsback, and the line of chalk-hills
which runs to Boxhill, and stretched hundreds of feet above your head
as you stand on Hind Head or Leith Hill, right over the old Weald of
Sussex to the chalk of the South Downs.&nbsp; And out of the scourings
of that vast mass of chalk was our gravel-pit made.</p>
<p>Of that, and also of the Hind Head sands below it.</p>
<p>For you will find a great deal of sharp sand in our gravel-pits,
which has not, I believe, come from the grinding of chalk flints; for
if it had been ground, it would not be the sharp sand it is; the particles
would be rounded off at the edges.&nbsp; This is probably sand from
the Hind Head; from what geologists term the greensands, below the chalk.</p>
<p>And I have a better proof of this&mdash;at least I should have in
every gravel-pit at Eversley&mdash;in a few pieces of a stone which
is not chalk-flint at all; flattish and oblong, not more than two or
three inches in diameter; of a grayish colour, and a porous worm-eaten
surface, which no chalk-flint ever has.&nbsp; They are chert, which
abound in the greensand formation; and insignificant as they look, are
a great token of a most important fact; that the currents which formed
our sands and gravels set from the south during a long series of ages,
first till they had washed away all the chalk off the Weald, and next
till they had washed away a great part of the sands, which then became
exposed, the remains whereof form great commons over a wide tract of
Surrey.</p>
<p>Now let me pause, and ask you to observe one thing.&nbsp; How, in
inductive science, we arrive, by patient and simple observation of the
things around us, at the most grand and surprising results.&nbsp; Of
course I am not giving you the whole of the facts which have made this
argument certain.&nbsp; I am only giving you enough to make it probable
to you.&nbsp; Its certainty has been proved by many different men, labouring
in many different parts of England, and of the Continent also, and then
comparing their discoveries together; often, of course, making mistakes;
but each working on patiently, and correcting their early mistakes by
fresh facts, till they have at last got hold of the true key to the
mystery, and are as certain of the existence of the great island of
the Weald, and its gradual destruction by the waves and currents of
an ancient sea, as if they had seen it with their bodily eyes.&nbsp;
You must take all this, of course, as truth from me to-night; but you
may go and examine for yourselves; and see how far your own common sense
and observations agree with those of learned geologists.</p>
<p>The history of this great Wealden island to the south-east of us
is obscure enough; but a few general facts, which bear upon our gravel-pit,
I can give you.</p>
<p>I must begin, however, ages before the Wealden island existed; when
the chalk of which its mass was composed was at the bottom of a deep
ocean.</p>
<p>We know now what chalk is, and how it was made.&nbsp; We know that
it was deposited as white lime mud, at a vast sea-depth, seemingly undisturbed
by winds or currents.&nbsp; We know that not only the flint, but the
chalk itself, is made up of shells; the shell of little microscopic
animalcules smaller than a needle&rsquo;s point, in millions of millions,
some whole, some broken, some in powder, which lived, and died, and
decayed for ages in the great chalk sea.</p>
<p>We know this, I say.&nbsp; We had suspected it long ago, and become
more and more certain of it as the years went on.&nbsp; But now we seem
to have a proof of it which is past gainsaying.</p>
<p>In the late survey of the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, with a view
to laying down the electric telegraph between England and America, by
Lieutenant Maury of the American navy, a great discovery was made.&nbsp;
It was found that the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, after you have left
the land a few hundred miles, is one vast plain of mud, of some thirteen
hundred miles in breadth.&nbsp; But here is the wonder; it was found
that at a depth, averaging 1,600 fathoms&mdash;9,600 feet&mdash;in utter
darkness, the sea floor is covered with countless millions of animalcule-shells,
of the same families, though not of the same species, as those which
compose the chalk.</p>
<p>At the bottom of a still ocean, then, the chalk was deposited.&nbsp;
But it took many an age to raise it to where Odiham chalk-pit now stands.</p>
<p>But how was it raised?</p>
<p>By the upheaving force of earthquakes.&nbsp; Or rather, by the upheaving
force which causes earthquakes, when it acts in a single shock, cracking
the earth&rsquo;s crust by an explosion; but which acts, too, slowly
and quietly, uplifting day by day, and year by year, some portions of
the earth&rsquo;s surface, and letting others sink down; as in the case
of the valley of the Jordan and the Dead Sea, which is now 1,300 feet
below the level of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>That these upheaving forces were much more violent than now, in the
earlier epochs of our planet, we have some reason to believe: but the
subject is too long a one to enter on now; and all I can say is, that
you must conceive for yourself the chalk gradually brought up to the
surface, worn away along a shifting shoreline by the waves of the sea,
and covered in shallow water by the clays and sands on which Odiham
stands; and which compose the earliest part of our second world.</p>
<p>A second world; a new world.&nbsp; We can use no weaker expression.&nbsp;
When we compare the chalk with the strata which lie upon it, we can
only call them a complete new creation.</p>
<p>For not only were they deposited in shallow water; a great deal of
them, probably, near river-mouths, and by the force of violent currents,
as the irregularity of their lower bed proves: but there is hardly a
plant or animal found in the chalk itself, which is found in the gravels,
sands, or clays above it.&nbsp; The shells are all new species; unseen
before in this planet.&nbsp; The vegetables, as far as we know them,
are all different from anything found in the chalk, or in the beds below
it.&nbsp; God Almighty, for His own good pleasure, has made all things
new.&nbsp; It is a very awful fact; but it is a very certain one.&nbsp;
Several times, in the history of our planet, has the Lord God fulfilled
the words of the Psalmist:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou takest away their breath, they die, and return again
to their dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou sendest forth thy breath, they are made: and thou renewest
the face of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in no instance, perhaps, is the gulf so vast; is the leap from
one world to another so sheer, as that between the chalk and the London
clay above it.</p>
<p>But how do I know that there was a shore-line here?&nbsp; And how
do I know that the chalk was covered with sand-beds?</p>
<p>I know that there was a shore-line here, from this fact.&nbsp; If
you will look at the surface of the chalk, where the sands and clays
lie on it, you will find that it is not smooth; that the beds do not
rest conformably on each other, as if they had been laid down quietly
by successive tides, while the chalk below was still soft mud.&nbsp;
So far from it, the chalk must have become hard rock, and have been
exposed to the action of the sea waves, for centuries, perhaps, before
the sands began to cover it.&nbsp; For you find the surface of the chalk
furrowed, worn into deep pits, which are often filled with sand, and
gravel, and rounded lumps of chalk.&nbsp; You may see this for yourselves,
in the topmost layer of any chalk-pit round here.&nbsp; You may see,
even, in some places, the holes which boring shells, such as work now
close to the tide-level, have made in it; all the signs, in fact, of
the chalk having been a rocky sea-beach for ages.</p>
<p>The first bed which you will generally find upon the water-worn surface
of the chalk is a layer of green-sand and green-coated flints.&nbsp;
Among these are met with in many places beds of a great oyster, now
unknown in life.&nbsp; I cannot say whether there are any here; but
at Reading, to the east of Farnham, at Croydon, and under London, they
are abundant.&nbsp; There must have been miles and miles of oyster-bed
at the bottom of that Eocene sea; among the oyster-beds, beds of a peculiar
pebble, which we shall see in our gravel-pit.</p>
<p>They are flints; but very small, dark, often almost black, and quite
round and polished.&nbsp; Compare them with the average flints of the
pit, and you see that while the average flints are fresh from the chalk,
these have plainly been rolled and rounded for years.&nbsp; They are
(except in their dark colour) exactly such shingle as forms the south-coast
beach about Hastings and Brighton.&nbsp; They are the shingle beaches
of the Eocene sea, part of which are preserved under the London clay.&nbsp;
To the north a vast bed of them remains in its original place, on Blackheath
near London; while part, in the district to the south, which the London
clay has not covered, have been washed away, and carried into our gravel-pit,
to mingle with other flints fresh from the chalk.</p>
<p>I said just now that I had proof that a great tract of the chalk-hills
which are now bare, was once covered with sand and gravel.&nbsp; Here,
in the presence of these dark pebbles, is a proof.&nbsp; But I have
another, and a yet more curious one.</p>
<p>For our gravel-pit, if it be, will possibly yield us another, and
a more curious object.&nbsp; You most of you have seen, I dare say,
large stones, several feet long, taken out of these pits.&nbsp; In the
gravels and sands at Pirbright they are so plentiful that they are quarried
for building-stone.&nbsp; And good building-stone they make; being exceedingly
hard, so that no weather will wear them away.&nbsp; They are what is
called saccharine (that is, sugary) sandstone.&nbsp; If you chip off
a bit, you find it exactly like fine whity-brown sugar, only intensely
hard.&nbsp; Now these stones have become very famous; for two reasons.&nbsp;
First, the old Druids used them to build their temples.&nbsp; Second,
it is a most puzzling question where they came from.</p>
<p>First.&nbsp; They were used to build Druid temples.</p>
<p>If you go to the further lodge of Dogmersfield Park, which opens
close to the Barley-mow Inn, you will see there several of them, about
five feet high each, set up on end.&nbsp; They run in a line through
the plantation past the lodge, along the park palings; one or two are
in an adjoining field.&nbsp; They are the remains of a double line;
an avenue of stones, which has formed part of an ancient British temple.</p>
<p>I know no more than that: of that I am certain.</p>
<p>But if you go to the Chalk Downs of Wiltshire, you see these temples
in their true grandeur.&nbsp; You have all heard of Stonehenge on Salisbury
Plain.&nbsp; Some of you may have heard of the great Druid temple at
Abury in Wilts, which, were it not all but destroyed, would be even
grander than Stonehenge.&nbsp; These are made of this same sugar-sandstone.</p>
<p>But where did the sandstone come from?&nbsp; You may say, it &ldquo;grew&rdquo;
of itself in our sands and gravels; but it certainly did not &ldquo;grow&rdquo;
on the top of a bare chalk down.&nbsp; The Druids must have brought
the stones thither, then, from neighbouring gravel-pits.&nbsp; They
brought them, no doubt: but not from gravel-pits.&nbsp; The stones are
found loose on the downs on the top of the bare chalk, in places where
they plainly have not been put by man.</p>
<p>For instance, near Marlborough is a long valley in the chalk, which,
for perhaps half a mile, is full of huge blocks of this sandstone, lying
about on the turf.&nbsp; The &ldquo;gray wethers&rdquo; the shepherds
call them.&nbsp; One look at them would show you that no man&rsquo;s
hand had put them there.&nbsp; They look like a river of stone, if I
may so speak; as if some mighty flood had rolled them along down the
valley, and there left them behind as it sunk.</p>
<p>Now, whence did they come?</p>
<p>Many answers have been given to that question.&nbsp; It was supposed
by many learned men that they had been brought from the sandstone mountains
of Wales, like the rolled pebbles of which I spoke just now.&nbsp; But
the answer to that was, that these great stones are not rolled: they
are all squarish, more or less; their edges are often sharp and fresh,
instead of being polished almost into balls, as they would have been
in rolling two hundred miles along a sea-bottom, before such a tremendous
current as would have been needed to carry them.</p>
<p>Then rose a very clever guess.&nbsp; They must have been carried
by icebergs, as much silt and stones (we know) has been carried, and
have dropped, like them, to the bottom, when the icebergs melted.</p>
<p>There is great reason in that; but we have cause now to be certain
that they did not come from Wales.&nbsp; That they are not pieces of
a rock older than the chalk, but much younger; that they were very probably
formed close to where they now lie.</p>
<p>Now&mdash;how do we know that?</p>
<p>If you are not tired with all this close reasoning, I will tell you.&mdash;If
you are, say so: but as I said at first, I want to show you what steady
and sharp head-work this same geology requires, even in the nearest
gravel-pit.</p>
<p>Well, then.&nbsp; I do not think our gravel-pit will tell us what
we want: but I know one which will.</p>
<p>You have all heard of Lady Grenville&rsquo;s lovely place, Dropmore,
beyond Maidenhead; where the taste of that good and great man, the late
Lord Grenville, converted into a paradise of landscape-gardening art
a barren common, full of clay and gravel-pits.&nbsp; Lord Grenville
wanted stones for rockwork; in those pits he found some blocks, of the
same substance as those of Stonehenge or Pirbright.&nbsp; And they contain
the answer.&nbsp; The upper surface of most of them is the usual clear
sugar-sandstone: but the under surface of many has round pebbles imbedded
in it, looking just like plums in a pudding; the smaller above and the
larger below, as if they had sunk slowly through the fluid sand, before
the whole mass froze, as it were, suddenly together.&nbsp; And these
pebbles are nothing else than rolled chalk flints.</p>
<p>That settles the matter.&nbsp; The pebbles could not come from Wales;
there are no flints there.&nbsp; They could not have been made before
the chalk; for out of the chalk they came; and the only explanation
which is left to us, I believe, is, that over the tops of the chalk
downs; over our heads where we stand now, there once stretched layers
of sand and gravel, &ldquo;Tertiary strata&rdquo; as I have been calling
them to you; and among them layers of this same hard sandstone.</p>
<p>When the floods came they must have swept away all these soft sands
and gravels (possibly to make the Bagshot sands, of which I shall speak
presently), and left the chalk downs bare; but while they had strength
to move the finer particles, they had not generally strength to move
these sandstone blocks, but let them drop through, and remain upon the
freshly-bared floor of chalk, as the only relics of a tertiary land
long since swept away; while some were carried off, possibly by icebergs,
as far as Pirbright, and dropped, as the icebergs melted, both there,
at Dogmersfield, and also, though few and small, in Eversley and the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>But how came these tertiary sandstones to be so very hard, while
the strata around them are so soft?</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I know no more than you.&nbsp; Experience seems
to say that stone will not harden into that sugary crystalline state,
save under the influence of great heat: but I do not know how the heat
should have got to that layer in particular.&nbsp; Possibly there may
have been eruptions of steam, of boiling water holding silex (flint)
in solution&mdash;a very rare occurrence: but something similar is still
going on in the famous Geysers or boiling springs of Iceland.&nbsp;
However, I have no proof that this was the cause.&nbsp; I suppose we
shall find out some day how it happened; for we must never despair of
finding out anything which depends on facts.</p>
<p>Part of the town of Odiham, and of North Warnborough, stands, I believe,
upon these lower beds, which are called by geologists the Woolwich and
Reading beds, and the Plastic clays, from the good brick earth which
is so often found among them.&nbsp; But as soon as you get to Hook Common,
and to Dogmersfield Park, you enter on a fresh deposit; the great bed
of the London clay.</p>
<p>I give you a rough section, from a deep well at Dogmersfield House;
from which you may see how steeply the chalk dips down here under the
clay, so that Odiham stands, as it were, on the chalk beach of the clay
sea.</p>
<p>In boring that well there were pierced:</p>
<p>Forty feet of the upper sands (the Bagshot sands), of which I shall
speak presently.</p>
<p>Three hundred and thirty feet of London clay.</p>
<p>Then about forty feet of mottled clays and sands.</p>
<p>Whether the chalk was then reached, I do not know.&nbsp; It must
have been close below.&nbsp; But these mottled clays and sands abound
in water (being indeed the layer which supplies the great breweries
in London, and those soda-water bottles on dumb-waiters which squirt
in Trafalgar Square); and (I suppose) the water being reached, the boring
ceased.</p>
<p>Now, this great bed of London clay, even more than the sands below
it, deserves the title of a new creation.</p>
<p>As a proof&mdash;some of you may recollect, when the South-Western
Railway was in making, seeing shells&mdash;some of them large and handsome
ones&mdash;Nautili, taken out of the London clay cutting near Winchfield.</p>
<p>Nautili similar to them (but not the same) are now only found in
the hottest parts of the Indian seas; and what is more, not one of those
shells is the same as the shells you find in the chalk.&nbsp; Throughout
this great bed of London clay, the shells, the remains of plants and
animals, are altogether a new creation.&nbsp; If you look carefully
at the London clay shells, you will be struck with their general likeness
to fresh East Indian shells; and rightly so.&nbsp; They do approach
our modern live shells in form, far more than any which preceded them;
and indeed, a few of the London clay shells exist still in foreign seas;
in the beds, again, above the clay, you will meet with still more species
which are yet alive; while in the chalk, and below the chalk, you never
meet, I believe, with a single recent shell.&nbsp; It is for this reason
that the London clay is said to be Eocene, that is, the dawn of the
new creation.</p>
<p>The chalk, I told you, seems to have been deposited at the bottom
of a still and deep ocean.&nbsp; But the London clay, we shall find,
was deposited in a comparatively shallow sea, least in depth toward
High Clere on the west, and deepening towards London and the mouth of
the Thames.</p>
<p>For not only is the clay deeper as you travel eastward, but&mdash;and
this is a matter to which geologists attach great importance&mdash;the
character of the shells differs in different parts of the clay.</p>
<p>You must know that certain sorts of shells live in deep water, and
certain in shallow.&nbsp; You may prove this to yourselves, on a small
scale, whenever you go to the seaside.&nbsp; You will find that the
shell which crawl on the rocks about high-water mark are different from
those which you find at low-tide mark; and those again different from
the shells which are brought up by the oyster-dredgers from the sea
outside.&nbsp; Now, the lower part of the clay, near here, contains
shallow-water shells: but if you went forty miles to the eastward, you
would find in the corresponding lower beds of the clay, deep-water shells,
and far above them, shallow-water shells such as you find here: a fact
which shows plainly that this end of the clay sea was shallowest, and
therefore first filled up.</p>
<p>But again&mdash;and this is a very curious fact&mdash;between the
time of the Plastic clays and sands, with their oyster-beds and black
pebbles, and that of the London clay, great changes had taken place.&nbsp;
The Plastic clay and sands were deposited during a period of earthquake,
of upheaval and subsidence of ancient lands; and therefore of violent
currents and flood waves, seemingly rushing down from, or round the
shores of that Wealden island to the south of us, on the shore of which
island Odiham once stood.&nbsp; We know this from the great irregularity
of the beds: while the absence of that irregularity proves to us that
the London clay was deposited in a quiet sea.</p>
<p>But more.&nbsp; A great change in the climate of this country had
taken place meanwhile; slowly perhaps: but still it had taken place.</p>
<p>In the lowest clay above the chalk are found at Reading many leaves,
and buds, and seeds of trees, showing that there was dry land near;
and these trees, as far as the best botanists can guess, were trees
like those we have in England now.&nbsp; Not of the same species, of
course: but still trees belonging to a temperate climate, which had
its regular warm summer and cold winter.</p>
<p>But before the London clay had been all deposited, this temperate
climate had changed to a tropical one; and the plants and animals of
the upper part of the London clay had begun to resemble rather those
of the mouths of the African slave-rivers.</p>
<p>Extraordinary as this is, it is certainly true.</p>
<p>We know that the country near the mouth of the Thames, and probably
the land round us here, was low rich soil, some half under water, some
overflowed by rivers; some by fresh or brackish pools.&nbsp; We know
all this; for we find the shells which belong to a shallow sea, mixed
with fresh-water ones.&nbsp; We know, too, that the climate of this
rich lowland was a tropical one.&nbsp; We know that the neighbourhood
of the Isle of Sheppey, at the mouth of the Thames, was covered with
rich tropic vegetation; with screw pines and acacias, canes and gourds,
tenanted by opossums, bats, and vultures: that huge snakes twined themselves
along the ground, tortoises dived in the pools, and crocodiles basked
on the muds, while the neighbouring seas swarmed with sharks as huge
and terrible as those of a West Indian shore.</p>
<p>It is all very wonderful, ladies and gentlemen: but be it is: and
all we can say is, with the Mussulman&mdash;&ldquo;God is great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then&mdash;when, none knows but God&mdash;there came a time in
which some convulsion of nature changed the course of the sea currents,
and probably destroyed a vast tract of land between England and France,
and probably also, that sunken island of Atlantis of which old Plato
dreamed&mdash;the vast tract which connected for ages Ireland, Cornwall,
Brittany, and Portugal.&nbsp; That convulsion covered up the rich clays
with those barren sands and gravels, which now rise in flat and dreary
steppes, on the Beacon Hill, Aldershot Moors, Hartford Bridge Flat,
Frimley ridges, and Windsor Forest.&nbsp; That rich old world was all
swept away, and instead of it desolation and barrenness, piling up slowly
on its ruins a desert of sand and shingle, rising inch by inch out of
a lifeless sea.&nbsp; There is something very awful to me in the barrenness
of those Bagshot sands, after the rich tropic life of the London clay.&nbsp;
Not a fossil is to be found in them for miles.&nbsp; Save a few shells,
I believe, near Pirbright, there is not a hint that a living being inhabited
that doleful sea.</p>
<p>But do not suppose, gentlemen and ladies, that we have yet got our
gravel-pit made, or that the way-worn pebbles of which it is composed
are near the end of their weary journey.&nbsp; Poor old stones!&nbsp;
Driven out of their native chalk, rolled for ages on a sea-beach, they
have tried to get a few centuries&rsquo; sleep in the Eocene sands on
the top of the chalk hills behind us, while the London clay was being
deposited peacefully in the tropic sea below; and behold, they are swept
out, once more, and hurled pell-mell upon the clay, two hundred feet
over our heads.</p>
<p>Over our heads, remember.&nbsp; We have come now to a time when Hartford
Bridge Flats stretched away to the Beacon Hill, and many a mile to the
south-eastward&mdash;even down into Kent, and stretched also over Winchfield
and Dogmersfield hither.</p>
<p>What broke them up?&nbsp; What furrowed out their steep side-valleys?&nbsp;
What formed the magnificent escarpment of the Beacon Hill, or the lesser
one of Finchamstead Ridges?&nbsp; What swept away all but a thin cap
of them on the upper part of Dogmersfield Park, another under Winchfield
House; another at Bearwood, and so forth?</p>
<p>The convulsions of a third world; more fertile in animal life than
those which preceded it: but also, more terrible and rapid, if possible,
in its changes.</p>
<p>Of this third world, the one which (so to speak) immediately preceded
our own, we know little yet.&nbsp; Its changes are so complicated that
geologists have as yet hardly arranged them.&nbsp; But what we can see,
I will sketch for you shortly.</p>
<p>A great continent to the south&mdash;England, probably an island
at the beginning of the period, united to the continent by new beds&mdash;the
Mammoth ranging up to where we now stand.</p>
<p>Then a period of upheaval.&nbsp; The German Ocean becomes dry land.&nbsp;
The Thames, a far larger river than now, runs far eastward to join the
Seine, and the Rhine, and other rivers, which altogether flow northward,
in one enormous stream, toward the open sea between Scotland and Norway.</p>
<p>And with this, a new creation of enormous quadrupeds, as yet unknown.&nbsp;
Countless herds of elephants pastured by the side of that mighty river,
where now the Norfolk fisherman dredges their teeth and bones far out
in open sea.&nbsp; The hippopotamus floundered in the Severn, the rhinoceros
ranged over the south-western counties; enormous elk and oxen, of species
now extinct, inhabited the vast fir and larch forests which stretched
from Norfolk to the farthest part of Wales; hyenas and bears double
the size of our modern ones, and here and there the sabre-toothed tiger,
now extinct, prowled out of the caverns in the limestone hills, to seek
their bulky prey.</p>
<p>We see, too, a period&mdash;whether the same as this, or after it,
I know not yet&mdash;in which the mountains of Wales and Cumberland
rose to the limits of eternal frost, and Snowdon was indeed Snowdon,
an alp down whose valleys vast glaciers spread far and wide; while the
reindeer of Lapland, the marmot of the Alps, and the musk ox of Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay, fed upon alpine plants, a few of whose descendants still survive,
as tokens of the long past age of ice.&nbsp; And at every successive
upheaval of the western mountains the displaced waters of the ocean
swept over the lower lands, filling the valley of the Thames and of
the Wey with vast beds of drift gravel, containing among its chalk flints,
fragments of stone from every rock between here and Wales, teeth of
elephants, skulls of ox and musk ox; while icebergs, breaking away from
the glaciers of the Welsh Alps, sailed down over the spot where we now
are, dropping their imbedded stones and silt, to confuse more utterly
than before the records of a world rocking and throbbing above the shocks
of the nether fire.</p>
<p>At last the convulsions get weak.&nbsp; The German Ocean becomes
sea once more; the north-western Alps sink again to a level far lower
even than their present one; only to rise again, but not so high as
before; sea-beaches and sea-shells fill many of our lower valleys; whales
by hundreds are stranded (as in the Farnham vale) where is now dry land.&nbsp;
Gradually the sunken land begins to rise again, and falls perhaps again,
and rises again after that, more and more gently each time, till as
it were the panting earth, worn out with the fierce passions of her
fiery youth, has sobbed herself to sleep once more, and this new world
of man is made.&nbsp; And among it, I know not when, or by what diluvial
wave out of hundreds which swept the Pleistocene earth, was deposited
our little gravel-pit, from which we started on our journey through
three worlds.</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p>Enough for us that He knows when, in whose hand are the times and
the seasons&mdash;God the Father of the spirits of all flesh.</p>
<p>And now, ladies and gentlemen, take from hence a lesson.&nbsp; I
have brought you a long and a strange road.&nbsp; Starting from this
seemingly uninteresting pit, we have come upon the records of three
older worlds, and on hints of worlds far older yet.&nbsp; We have come
to them by no theories, no dreams of the fancy, but by plain honest
reasoning, from plain honest facts.&nbsp; That wonderful things had
happened, we could see: but why they had happened, we saw not.&nbsp;
When we began to ask the reason of this thing or of that, remember how
we had to stop, and laying our hands upon our mouths, only say with
the Mussulman: &ldquo;God is great.&rdquo;&nbsp; We pick our steps,
by lanthorn light indeed, and slowly, but still surely and safely, along
a dark and difficult road: but just as we are beginning to pride ourselves
on having found our way so cleverly, we come to an edge of darkness;
and see before our feet a bottomless abyss, down which our feeble lanthorn
will not throw its light a yard.</p>
<p>Such is true science.&nbsp; Is it a study to make men conceited and
self-sufficient?&nbsp; Believe it not.&nbsp; If a scientific man, or
one who calls himself so, be conceited, the conceit was there before
the science; part of his natural defects: and if it stays there long
after he has really given himself to the patient study of nature, then
is he one of those of whom Solomon has said: &ldquo;Though you pound
a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his folly
depart from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For what more fit to knock the conceit out of a student, than being
pounded by these same hard facts&mdash;which tell him just enough to
let him know&mdash;how little he knows?&nbsp; What more fit to make
a man patient, humble, reverent, than being stopped short, as every
man of science is, after each half-dozen steps, by some tremendous riddle
which he cannot explain&mdash;which he may have to wait years to get
explained&mdash;which as far as he can see will never be explained at
all?</p>
<p>The poet says: &ldquo;An undevout astronomer is mad,&rdquo; and he
says truth.&nbsp; It is only those who know a little of nature, who
fancy that they know much.&nbsp; I have heard a young man say, after
hearing a few popular chemical lectures, and seeing a few bottle and
squirt experiments: Oh, water&mdash;water is only oxygen and hydrogen!&mdash;as
if he knew all about it.&nbsp; While the true chemist would smile sadly
enough at the youth&rsquo;s hasty conceit, and say in his heart: &ldquo;Well,
he is a lucky fellow.&nbsp; If he knows all about it, it is more than
I do.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what oxygen <i>is</i>, or hydrogen, either.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t even know whether there are any such things at all.&nbsp;
I see certain effects in my experiments which I must attribute to some
cause, and I call that cause oxygen, because I must call it something;
and other effects which I must attribute to another cause, and I call
that hydrogen.&nbsp; But as for oxygen, I don&rsquo;t know whether it
really exists.&nbsp; I think it very possible that it is only an effect
of something else&mdash;another form of a something, which seems to
make phosphorus, iodine, bromine, and certain other substances: and
as for hydrogen&mdash;I know as little about it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know but what all the metals, gold, silver, iron, tin, sodium, potassium,
and so forth, are not different forms of hydrogen, or of something else
which is the parent of hydrogen.&nbsp; In fact, I know but very little
about the matter; except this, that I do know very little; and that
the more I experiment, and the more I analyse, the more unexpected puzzles
and wonders I find, and the more I expect to find till my dying day.&nbsp;
True, I know a vast number of facts and laws, thank God; and some very
useful ones among them: but as to the ultimate and first causes of those
facts and laws, I know no more than the shepherd-boy outside; and can
say no more than he does, when he reads in the Psalms at school: &ldquo;I,
and all around me, are fearfully and wonderfully made; marvellous are
Thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, my friends, though I have seemed to talk to you of great
matters this night; of the making and the destruction of world after
world: yet what does all I have said come to?&nbsp; I have not got one
step beyond what the old Psalmist learnt amid the earthquakes and volcanoes
of the pastures and the forests of Palestine, three thousand years ago.&nbsp;
I have not added to his words; I have only given you new facts to prove
that he had exhausted the moral lesson of the subject, when he said:</p>
<p>These all wait upon thee, that thou mayest give them their meat in
due season.</p>
<p>Thou givest, and they gather: thou openest thy hand, and they are
filled with good.</p>
<p>Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou takest away their breath;
they die and return to their dust.</p>
<p>Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created; and thou renewest
the face of the earth.</p>
<p>But&mdash;The glory of the Lord shall endure for ever.&nbsp; The
Lord shall rejoice in his works.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<h2>HOW TO STUDY NATURAL HISTORY <a name="citation290"></a><a href="#footnote290">{290}</a></h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I speak to you to-night as to persons assembled,
somewhat, no doubt, for amusement, but still more for instruction.&nbsp;
Institutions such as this were originally founded for the purpose of
instruction; to supply to those who wish to educate themselves some
of the advantages of a regular course of scholastic or scientific training,
by means of classes and of lectures.</p>
<p>I myself prize classes far higher than I do lectures.&nbsp; From
my own experience, a lecture is often a very dangerous method of teaching;
it is apt to engender in the mind of men ungrounded conceit and sciolism,
or the bad habit of knowing about subjects without really knowing the
subject itself.&nbsp; A young man hears an interesting lecture, and
carries away from it doubtless a great many new facts and results: but
he really must not go home fancying himself a much wiser man; and why?&nbsp;
Because he has only heard the lecturer&rsquo;s side of the story.&nbsp;
He has been forced to take the facts and the results on trust.&nbsp;
He has not examined the facts for himself.&nbsp; He has had no share
in the process by which the results were arrived at.&nbsp; In short,
he has not gone into the real scientia, that is, the &ldquo;knowing&rdquo;
of the matter.&nbsp; He has gained a certain quantity of second-hand
information: but he has gained nothing in mental training, nothing in
the great &ldquo;art of learning,&rdquo; the art of finding out things
for himself, and of discerning truth from falsehood.&nbsp; Of course,
where the lecture is a scientific one, illustrated by diagrams, this
defect is not so extreme: but still the lecturer who shows you experiments,
is forced to choose those which shall be startling and amusing, rather
than important; he is seldom or never able, unless he is a man of at
once the deepest science and the most extraordinary powers of amusing,
to give you those experiments in the proper order which will unfold
the subject to you step by step; and after all, an experiment is worth
very little to you, unless you perform it yourself, ask questions about
it, or vary it a little to solve difficulties which arise in your own
mind.</p>
<p>Now mind&mdash;I do not say all this to make you give up attending
lectures.&nbsp; Heaven forbid.&nbsp; They amuse, that is, they turn
the mind off from business; they relax it, and as it were bathe and
refresh it with new thoughts, after the day&rsquo;s drudgery or the
day&rsquo;s commonplaces; they fill it with pleasant and healthful images
for afterthought.&nbsp; Above all, they make one feel what a fair, wide,
wonderful world one lives in; how much there is to be known, and how
little one knows; and to the earnest man suggest future subjects of
study.&nbsp; I only ask you not to expect from lectures what they can
never give; but as to what they can give, I consider, I assure you,
the lecturer&rsquo;s vocation a most honourable one in the present day,
even if we look on him as on a mere advertiser of nature&rsquo;s wonders.&nbsp;
As such I appear here to-night; not to teach you natural history; for
that you can only teach yourselves: but to set before you the subject
and its value, and if possible, allure some of you to the study of it.</p>
<p>I have said that lectures do not supply mental training; that only
personal study can do that.&nbsp; The next question is, What study?&nbsp;
And that is a question which I do not answer in a hurry, when I say,
The study of natural history.&nbsp; It is not, certainly, a study which
a young man entering on the business of self-education would be likely
to take up.&nbsp; To him, naturally, man is the most important subject.&nbsp;
His first wish is to know the human world; to know what men are, what
they have thought, what they have done.&nbsp; And therefore, you find
that poetry, history, politics, and philosophy are the matters which
most attract the self-guided student.&nbsp; I do not blame him, but
he seems to me to be beginning at the middle, rather than at the beginning.&nbsp;
I fell into the same fault myself more than once, when I was younger,
and meddled in matters too high for me, instead of refraining my soul,
and keeping it low; so I can sympathise with others who do so.&nbsp;
But I can assure them that they will find such lofty studies do them
good only in proportion as they have first learnt the art of learning.&nbsp;
Unless they have learnt to face facts manfully, to discriminate between
them skilfully, to draw conclusions from them rigidly; unless they have
learnt in all things to look, not for what they would like to be true,
but for what is true, because God has done it, and it cannot be undone&mdash;then
they will be in danger of taking up only the books which suit their
own prejudices&mdash;and every one has his prejudices&mdash;and using
them, not to correct their own notions, but to corroborate and pamper
them; to confirm themselves in their first narrow guesses, instead of
enlarging those guesses into certainty.&nbsp; The son of a Tory turn
will read Tory books, the son of a Radical turn Radical books; and the
green spectacles of party and prejudice will be deepened in hue as he
reads on, instead of being thrown away for the clear white glass of
truth, which will show him reason in all honest sides, and good in all
honest men.</p>
<p>But, says the young man, I wish to be wide-minded and wide-hearted&mdash;I
study for that very purpose.&nbsp; I will be fair, I will be patient,
I will hear all sides ere I judge.&nbsp; And I doubt not that he speaks
honestly.&nbsp; But (I quote with all reverence) though the spirit be
willing, the flesh is weak.&nbsp; Studies which have to do with man&rsquo;s
history, man&rsquo;s thoughts, man&rsquo;s feelings, are too exciting,
too personal, often, alas, too tragical, to allow us to read them calmly
at first.&nbsp; The men and women of whom we read are so like ourselves
(for the human heart is the same in every age), that we unconsciously
begin to love or hate them in the first five minutes, and read history
as we do a novel, hurrying on to see when the supposed hero and heroine
get safely married, and the supposed villain safely hanged, at the end
of the chapter, having forgotten all the while, in our haste, to ascertain
which is the hero and which is the villain.&nbsp; Mary Queen of Scots
was &ldquo;beautiful and unfortunate&rdquo;&mdash;what heart would not
bleed for a beautiful woman in trouble?&nbsp; Why stop to ask whether
she brought it on herself?&nbsp; She was seventeen years in prison.&nbsp;
Why stop to ascertain what sort of a prison it was?&nbsp; And as for
her guilt, the famous Casket Letters were, of course, a vile forgery.&nbsp;
Impossible that they could be true.&nbsp; Hoot down the cold-hearted,
and disagreeable, and troublesome man of facts, who will persist in
his stupid attempt to disenchant you, and repeat&mdash;But the Casket
Letters were not a forgery, and we can prove it, if you will but listen
to the facts.&nbsp; Her prison, as we will show you (if you will be
patient and listen to facts), consisted in greater pomp and luxury than
that of most noblemen, with horses, hounds, books, music, liberty to
hunt and amuse herself in every way, even in intriguing with every court
of Europe, as we can show you again, if you will be patient and listen
to facts.&nbsp; And she herself was a very wicked and false woman, an
adulteress and a murderess (though fearfully ill-trained in early youth),
who sowed the wind, poor wretch, from girlhood to old age, and therefore
reaped the whirlwind, receiving the just reward of her deeds.&nbsp;
Catherine of Russia, meanwhile, instead of being beautiful and unfortunate,
was only handsome and successful.&nbsp; Brand her as a disgrace to human
nature.&nbsp; The morals and ways of the two were pretty much on a par,
with these exceptions in Catherine&rsquo;s favour&mdash;that she had
strong passions, Mary none; that she lived in outer darkness and practical
heathendom, while Mary had the light shining all round her, and refused
it deliberately again and again.&nbsp; What matter to the sentimentalist?&nbsp;
Hiss the stupid hard-hearted man of facts, by all means.&nbsp; What
if he be right?&nbsp; He has no business to be right; we will consider
him wrong accordingly, of our own sovereign will and pleasure.&nbsp;
For after all, if we had the facts put before us (says the conscience
of many a hearer), we could not judge of them; we read to be amused
and instructed, not to study cases like so many barristers.&nbsp; So
is history read.&nbsp; And so, alas, is history written, too often,
for want of a steady and severe training which would enable people to
judge dispassionately of facts.&nbsp; In politics the case is the same.&nbsp;
In poetry, which appeals more directly to the feelings, it must needs
be still worse; as has been shown sadly enough of late by the success
of several poems, in which every possible form of bad taste has only
met with unbounded admiration from the many who have not had their senses
exercised to discern between good and evil.</p>
<p>Now what seems to me to be wanted for young minds, is a study in
which no personal likes or dislikes shall tempt them out of the path
of mental honesty; a study in which they shall be free to look at facts
exactly as they are, and draw their conclusions patiently and dispassionately.&nbsp;
And such a study I have found in that of natural history.</p>
<p>Do not fancy it, I beg you, an easy thing to judge fairly of facts;
even to discover the facts at all, when they are staring you in the
face; and to see what it is that you do see.&nbsp; Any lawyer will tell
you, that if you ask three honest men to bear testimony concerning an
event which happened but yesterday, none of them, if he be at all an
interested party, will give you exactly the same account of it: not
that he wishes to say what is untrue; but that different parts of the
whole matter having struck each man with different force, a different
picture has been left on each man&rsquo;s memory.&nbsp; I have been
utterly astounded of late, in investigating these strange stories of
table-turning and spirit-rapping, to find how even clear-headed and
well-instructed persons (as one had fancied them) become unable to examine
fairly into a thing, the moment the desire to believe has entered the
heart; and how no amount of mere cultivation, if the scientific habit
of mind be wanting, can prevent people from finding (as in table-turning)
miracles in the most simple mechanical accidents; or from becoming (as
in spirit-rapping) the dupes of the most clumsy, palpable, and degrading
impostures, even after they have been exposed over and over again in
print.&nbsp; Humiliating, indeed, it is, in this so self-confident and
boastful nineteenth century, amid steam-engines, railroads, electric
telegraphs, and all the wonders of our inductive science, to find exploded
superstitions leaping back into life even more monstrous and irrational
than in past ages, and to see our modern Pharisees and Sadducees, like
those in Judea of old, seeking after a sign of an unseen world; and
being unable to find one either in the heaven above or in the earth
beneath, discovering it at last (I am almost ashamed to speak the words)
under the parlour-table.</p>
<p>Against such extravagances, and against the loose sentimental tone
of mind which begets them, hardly anything would be a better safeguard
than the habitual study of nature.&nbsp; The chemist, the geologist,
the botanist, the zoologist, has to deal with facts which will make
him master of them, and of himself, only in proportion as he obeys them.&nbsp;
Many of you doubtless know Lord Bacon&rsquo;s famous apothegm, Nature
is only conquered by obeying her; and will understand me when I say,
that you cannot understand, much less use for scientific purposes, the
meanest pebble, unless you first obey that pebble.&nbsp; Paradoxical;
but true.</p>
<p>See this pebble which I hold in my hand, picked up out of the street
as I came along; it shall be my only object to-night.&nbsp; There the
thing is; and is as it is, and in no other way; and such it will be,
and so it will behave and act, in spite of me, and all my fancies about
it, and notions of what it ought to have been like, and what it ought
to have done.&nbsp; It is a thought of God&rsquo;s; and strong by the
eternal laws of matter, which are the will of God.&nbsp; It has the
whole universe, sun, and stars, and all, backing it by God&rsquo;s appointment,
to keep it where it is and what it is; and till (as Lord Bacon has it)
I have discovered and obeyed the will of God revealed in that pebble,
it is to me a riddle more insoluble than the Sphinx&rsquo;s, a fortress
more impregnable than Sevastopol.&nbsp; I may crush it: but destroying
is not conquering: but I cannot even mend the road with it prudently,
until I have discovered whether Almighty God has made it fit to mend
roads with.&nbsp; I may have the genius of a Plato or of a Shakespeare,
but all my genius will not avail to penetrate that pebble, or see anything
in it but a little round dirty stone, until I have treated the pebble
with reverence, as a thing independent of my likes and dislikes, fancies,
and aspirations; and have asked it humbly to tell me its story, taking
counsel meanwhile of hundreds of kindred pebbles, each as silent and
reserved as this one; and watched and listened patiently, through many
mistakes and misreadings, to what it has to say for itself, and what
God has made it to be.&nbsp; And then at last that little black rounded
pebble, from the street outside, may, and will surely, if I be patient
and honest enough, tell me a tale wilder and grander than any which
I could have dreamed for myself; will shame the meanness of my imagination,
by the awful magnificence of God&rsquo;s facts, and say to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ages and &AElig;ons since, thousands on thousands of years
before there was a man to till the ground, I the little pebble was a
living sponge, in the milky depths of the great chalk ocean; and hundreds
of living atomies, each more fantastic than a ghost-painter&rsquo;s
dreams, swam round me, and grew on me, and multiplied, till I became
a tiny hive of wonders, each one of which would take you a life to understand.&nbsp;
And then, I cannot yet tell you how, and till I tell you you will never
know, the delicate flint-needles in my skin gathered other particles
of flint to them, and I and all my inhabitants became a stone; and the
chalk-mud settled round us, I know not how, and covered us in; and for
ages on ages I lay buried in the nether dark, and felt the glow of the
nether fires, and was cracked and tossed by a hundred earthquakes.&nbsp;
Again and again I have been part of an island, and then again sunk beneath
the sea, to be upheaved again after long centuries, till I saw the light
once more, and dropped from the face of some chalk cliff far away among
high hills which have long since been swept off the face of the earth,
and was tossed by currents till I became a pebble on the beach, while
Reading was a sand-bank in a shallow sea.&nbsp; There I lay and rolled
till I was rounded, for many a century more; till flood after flood
past over me, and a new earth was made; and I was mixed up with fresh
flints from wasting chalk-hills, and with freestones from the Gloucestershire
wolds, and with quartz-boulders from the mountains of Wales, while over
me swept the carcases of drowned elephants and bisons, and many a monstrous
beast; and above me floated uprooted palms, and tropic fruits and seeds,
and the wrecks of a dying world.&nbsp; And then there came another age&mdash;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>And it grew wondrous cold;<br />And ice mast-high came floating by,<br />As
green as emerald;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>and as the icebergs melted in the sun, the stones and the silt fell
out of them, and covered me up; and I was in darkness once more, vexed
by many an earthquake, till I became part of this brave English land.&nbsp;
And now I am a pebble here in Reading street, to be ground beneath the
wheels of busy men: and yet you cannot kill me, or hinder my fulfilling
the law which cannot be broken.&nbsp; This year I am a pebble in the
street; and next year I shall be dust upon the fields above; and the
year after that I shall be alive again, and rise from the ground as
fair green wheat-stems, bearing up food for the use of man.&nbsp; And
even after that you cannot kill me.&nbsp; The trampled and sodden straw
will rot only to enter into a new life; and I shall pass through a fresh
cycle of strange adventures, age after age, till time shall be no more;
doing my work in my generation, and fulfilling to the last the will
of God, as faithfully as when I was the water-breathing sponge in the
abysses of the old chalk sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this and more, gentlemen
and ladies, the pebble could tell to you, and will: but he is old and
venerable, and like old men, he wishes to be approached with respect,
and does not like to be questioned too much or too rapidly; so that
you must not be offended if you meet with more than one rebuff from
him; or if he keeps stubborn silence, till he has seen that you are
a modest and attentive person, to whom it is worth while to open a little
of his forty or fifty thousand years&rsquo; experience.</p>
<p>Second only to the good effect of this study on the logical faculty,
seems to me to be its effect on the imagination.&nbsp; Not merely in
such objects as the pebble, whose history I have so hastily, but I must
add faithfully, sketched; but in the tiniest piece of mould on a decayed
fruit, the tiniest animalcule from the stagnant pool, will imagination
find inexhaustible wonders, and fancy a fairy-land.&nbsp; And I beg
my elder hearers not to look on this as light praise.&nbsp; Imagination
is a valuable thing; and even if it were not, it is a thing, a real
thing, a faculty which every one has, and with which you must do something.&nbsp;
You cannot ignore it; it will assert its own existence.&nbsp; You will
be wise not to neglect it in young children; for if you do not provide
wholesome food for it, it will find unwholesome food for itself.&nbsp;
I know that many, especially men of business, are inclined to sneer
at it, and ask what is the use of it?&nbsp; The simple answer is, God
has made it; and He has made nothing in vain.&nbsp; But you will find
that in practice, in action, in business, imagination is a most useful
faculty, and is so much mental capital, whensoever it is properly trained.&nbsp;
Consider but this one thing, that without imagination no man can possibly
invent even the pettiest object; that it is one of the faculties which
essentially raises man above the brutes, by enabling him to create for
himself; that the first savage who ever made a hatchet must have imagined
that hatchet to himself ere he began it; that every new article of commerce,
every new opening for trade, must be arrived at by acts of imagination;
by the very same faculty which the poet or the painter employs, only
on a different class of objects; remember that this faculty is present
in some strength in every mind of any power, in every mind which can
do more than follow helplessly in the beaten track, and do nothing but
what it has seen others do already: and then see whether it be not worth
while to give the young a study which above all others is fitted to
keep this important and universal faculty in health.&nbsp; Now, from
fifty to five-and-twenty years ago, under the influence of the Franklin
and Edgeworth school of education, imagination was at a discount.&nbsp;
That school was a good school enough: but here was one of its faults.&nbsp;
It taught people to look on imagination as quite a useless, dangerous,
unpractical, bad thing, a sort of mental disease.&nbsp; And now, as
is usual after an unfair depreciation of anything, has come a revolution;
and an equally unfair glorifying of the imagination; the present generation
have found out suddenly that the despised faculty is worth something,
and therefore are ready to believe it worth everything; so that nowadays,
to judge from the praise heaped on some poets, the mere possession of
imagination, however ill regulated, will atone for every error of false
taste, bad English, carelessness for truth; and even for coarseness,
blasphemy, and want of common morality; and it is no longer charity,
but fancy, which is to cover the multitude of sins.</p>
<p>The fact is, that youth will always be the period of imagination;
and the business of a good education will always be to prevent that
imagination from being thrown inward, and producing a mental fever,
diseasing itself and the whole character by feeding on its own fancies,
its own day dreams, its own morbid feelings, its likes and dislikes;
even if it do not take at last to viler food, to French novels, and
lawless thoughts, which are but too common, alas! though we will not
speak of them here.</p>
<p>To turn the imagination not inwards, but outwards; to give it a class
of objects which may excite wonder, reverence, the love of novelty and
of discovering, without heating the brain or exciting the passions&mdash;this
is one of the great problems of education; and I believe from experience
that the study of natural history supplies in great part what we want.&nbsp;
The earnest naturalist is pretty sure to have obtained that great need
of all men, to get rid of self.&nbsp; He who, after the hours of business,
finds himself with a mind relaxed and wearied, will not be tempted to
sit at home dreaming over impossible scenes of pleasure, or to go for
amusement to haunts of coarse excitement, if he have in every hedge-bank,
and wood land, and running stream, in every bird among the boughs, and
every cloud above his head, stores of interest which will enable him
to forget awhile himself, and man, and all the cares, even all the hopes
of life, and to be alone with the inexhaustible beauty and glory of
Nature, and of God who made her.&nbsp; An hour or two every day spent
after business-hours in botany, geology, entomology, at the telescope
or the microscope, is so much refreshment gained for the mind for to-morrow&rsquo;s
labour, so much rest for irritated or anxious feelings, often so much
saved from frivolity or sin.&nbsp; And how easy this pursuit.&nbsp;
How abundant the subjects of it!&nbsp; Look round you here.&nbsp; Within
the reach of every one of you are wonders beyond all poets&rsquo; dreams.&nbsp;
Not a hedge-bank but has its hundred species of plants, each different
and each beautiful; and when you tire of them&mdash;if you ever can
tire&mdash;a trip into the meadows by the Thames, with the rich vegetation
of their dikes, floating flower-beds of every hue, will bring you as
it were into a new world, new forms, new colours, new delight.&nbsp;
You ask why this is?&nbsp; And you find yourself at once involved in
questions of soil and climate, which lead you onward, step by step,
into the deepest problems of geology and chemistry.&nbsp; In entomology,
too, if you have any taste for the beauties of form and colour, any
fondness for mechanical and dynamical science, the insects, even to
the smallest, will supply endless food for such likings; while their
instincts and their transformations, as well as the equally wondrous
chemical transformation of salts and gases into living plants, which
agricultural chemistry teaches you, will tempt you to echo every day
Mephistopheles&rsquo;s magic song, when he draws wine out of the table
in Auersbach&rsquo;s cellar:</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Wine is grapes, and grapes are wood&mdash;<br />The wooden board
yields wine as good:<br />It is but a deeper glance<br />Into Nature&rsquo;s
countenance.<br />All is plain to him who seeth;<br />Lift the veil
and look beneath,<br />And behold, the wise man saith,<br />Miracles,
if you have faith.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Believe me you need not go so far to find more than you will ever
understand.&nbsp; An hour&rsquo;s summer walk, in the company of some
one who knows what to look for and how to look for it, by the side of
one of those stagnant dikes in the meadows below, would furnish you
with subjects for a month&rsquo;s investigation, in the form of plants,
shells, and animalcules, on each of which a whole volume might be written.&nbsp;
And even at this seemingly dead season of the year, fancy not that nature
is dead&mdash;not even that she sleeps awhile.&nbsp; Every leaf which
drops from the bough, to return again into its gases and its dust, is
working out chemical problems which have puzzled a Boyle and a Lavoisier,
and about which a Liebig and a Faraday will now tell you that they have
but some dim guess, and that they stand upon the threshold of knowledge
like (as Newton said of himself) children gathering a few pebbles, upon
the shore of an illimitable sea.&nbsp; In every woodland, too, innumerable
fungi are at work, raising from the lower soil rich substances, which,
strewed on the surface by quick decay, will form food for plants higher
than themselves; while they, by their variety and beauty, both of form
and colour, might well form studies for any painter, and by the obscure
laws of their reproduction, studies for any philosopher.&nbsp; Why,
there is not a heap of dead leaves among which by picking it through
carefully you might not find some twenty species of delicate and elegant
land-shells; hardly a tree-foot at which, among the moss and mould,
you might not find the chrysalides of beautiful moths, where caterpillars
have crawled down the trunk in autumn, to lie there self-buried and
die to live again next spring in a new and fairer shape.&nbsp; And if
you cannot reach even there, go to the water-but in the nearest yard,
and there, in one pinch of green scum, in one spoonful of water, behold
a whole &ldquo;Divina Commedia&rdquo; of living forms, more fantastic
a thousand times than those with which Dante peopled his unseen world:
and then feel, as you should feel, abashed at the ignorance and weakness
of mortal man; abashed still more at that rash conceit of his, which
makes him fancy himself the measure of all things; and say with me:
&ldquo;Oh Lord, thy works are manifold; thy ways are very deep.&nbsp;
In wisdom hast thou made them all, the earth is full of thy riches.&nbsp;
Thou openest thy hand, and fillest all things living with plenteousness;
they continue this day according to thine ordinance, for all things
serve thee.&nbsp; Thou hast made them fast for ever and ever; thou hast
given them a law which shall not be broken.&nbsp; Let them praise the
name of the Lord; for he spake the word and they were made, he commanded,
and they were created.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This I shall say, but little more than this, on the religious effect
of the study of natural history.&nbsp; I do not wish to preach a sermon
to you.&nbsp; I can trust God&rsquo;s world to bear better witness than
I can, of the Loving Father who made it.&nbsp; I thank him from my own
experience for the testimony of His Creation, only next to the testimony
of His Bible.&nbsp; I have watched scientific discoveries which were
supposed in my boyhood to be contrary to revelation, found out one by
one to confirm and explain revelation, as crude and hasty theories were
corrected by more abundant facts, and men saw more clearly what both
the Bible and Nature really did say; and I can trust that the same process
will go on for ever, and that God&rsquo;s earth and God&rsquo;s word
will never contradict each other.&nbsp; I have found the average of
scientific men, not less, but more, godly and righteous men than the
average of their neighbours; and I can trust that this will be more
and more the case as science deepens and widens.&nbsp; And therefore
I can trust that every patient, truthful, and healthful mind will, the
more it contemplates the works of God, re-echo St. Paul&rsquo;s great
declaration that the Invisible things of God are clearly seen from the
foundation of the world, being understood by the things which are made,
even His eternal power and Godhead.&nbsp; And so trusting, I pass on
to a lower view of the subject, and yet not an unnecessary one.</p>
<p>In an industrial country like this, the practical utility of any
study must needs be always thrown into the scale; and natural history
seems at first sight somewhat unpractical.&nbsp; What money will it
earn for a man in after life?&mdash;is a question which will be asked;
and which it is folly to despise.&nbsp; For if the only answer be: &ldquo;None
at all,&rdquo; a man has a right to rejoin: &ldquo;Then let me take
up some pursuit which will train and refresh my mind as much as this
one, and yet be of pecuniary benefit to me some day.&rdquo;&nbsp; If
you can find such a study, by all means follow it: but I say that this
study too may be of great practical benefit in after life.&nbsp; How
much money have I, young as I am, seen wasted for want of a little knowledge
of botany, geology, or chemistry.&nbsp; How many a clever man becomes
the dupe of empirics for want of a little science.&nbsp; How many a
mine is sought for where no mine could be; or crop attempted to be grown,
where no such crop could grow.&nbsp; How many a hidden treasure, on
the other hand, do men walk over unheeding.&nbsp; How many a new material,
how many an improved process in manufacture is possible, yet is passed
over, for want of a little science.&nbsp; And for the man who emigrates,
and comes in contact with rude nature teeming with unsuspected wealth,
of what incalculable advantage to have if it be but the rudiments of
those sciences, which will tell him the properties, and therefore the
value, of the plants, the animals, the minerals, the climates with which
he meets?&nbsp; True&mdash;home-learnt natural history will not altogether
teach him about these things, because most of them must needs be new:
but it will teach him to compare and classify them as he finds them,
and so by analogy with things already known to him, to discover their
intrinsic worth.</p>
<p>For natural history stands to man&rsquo;s power over Nature, that
is, to his power of being useful to himself and to mankind, in the same
relation as do geography, grammar, arithmetic, geometry, political economy;
none of them, perhaps, bearing directly on his future business in life;
but all training his mind for his business, all giving him the rudiments
of laws which he will hereafter work out and apply to his profession.&nbsp;
And even at home, be sure that such studies will bear fruit in after
life.&nbsp; The productive wealth of England is not exhausted, doubt
it not; our grandchildren may find treasures in this our noble island
of which we never dreamed, even as we have found things of which our
forefathers dreamed not.&nbsp; Recollect always that a great market
town like this is not merely a commercial centre; not perhaps even a
commercial centre at all: but that she is an agricultural centre, and
one of the most important in England; that the increase of science here
will be sure more or less to extend itself to the neighbourhood: and
then lay to heart this one fact.&nbsp; A friend of mine, and one whom
I am proud to call my friend, succeeding to an estate, thought good
to cultivate it himself.&nbsp; And being a man of common sense, he thought
good to know something of what he was doing.&nbsp; And he said to himself:
The soil, and the rain, and the air are my raw materials.&nbsp; I ought
surely then to find out what soil, and rain, and air are; so I must
become a geologist and a meteorologist.&nbsp; Vegetable substances are
what I am to make.&nbsp; And I ought surely to know what it is that
I am making; so I must become a botanist.&nbsp; The raw material does
somehow or other become manufactured into the produce; the soil into
the vegetable.&nbsp; I ought surely to know a little about the processes
of my own manufacture; so I must learn chemistry.&nbsp; Chance and blind
custom are not enough for me.&nbsp; At best they can but leave me where
they found me, at their mercy.&nbsp; Science I need; and science I will
acquire.&nbsp; What was the result?&nbsp; After many a mistake and disappointment,
he succeeded in discovering on his own estate a mine of unsuspected
wealth&mdash;not of gold indeed, but of gold&rsquo;s worth&mdash;the
elements of human food.&nbsp; He discovered why some parts of his estate
were fertile, while others were barren; and by applying the knowledge
thus gained, he converted some of his most barren fields into his most
fertile ones; he preserved again and again his crops from blight, while
those of others perished all around him; he won for himself wealth,
and the respect and honour of men of science; while those around him,
slowly opening their eyes to his improvements, followed his lessons
at second-hand, till the whole agriculture of an important district
has become gradually but permanently improved, under the auspices of
one patient and brave man, who knew that knowledge was power, and that
only by obeying nature can man conquer her.</p>
<p>Bear in mind both these last great proverbs; and combine them in
your mind.&nbsp; Remember that while England is, and ever will be, behindhand
in metaphysical and scholastic science, she is the nation which above
all others has conquered nature by obeying her; that as it pleased God
that the author of that proverb, the father of inductive science, Bacon
Lord Verulam, should have been an Englishman, so it has pleased Him
that we, Lord Bacon&rsquo;s countrymen, should improve that precious
heirloom of science, inventing, producing, exporting, importing, till
it seems as if the whole human race, and every land from the equator
to the pole must henceforth bear the indelible impress and sign manual
of English science.</p>
<p>And bear in mind, as I said just now, that this study of natural
history is the grammar of that very physical science which has enabled
England thus to replenish the earth and subdue it.&nbsp; Do you not
see, then, that by following these studies you are walking in the very
path to which England owes her wealth; that you are training in yourselves
that habit of mind which God has approved as the one which He has ordained
for Englishmen, and are doing what in you lies toward carrying out,
in after life, the glorious work which God seems to have laid on the
English race, to replenish the earth and subdue it?</p>
<p>One word more, and I have done.&nbsp; Unless you are already tired
of hearing me, I would suggest a few practical hints before we part.&nbsp;
The best way of learning these matters is by classes, in which men may
combine and interchange their thoughts and observations.&nbsp; The greatest
savants find this; and have their Microscopic Society, Linn&aelig;an,
Royal, Geological Societies, British Associations, and what not, in
which all may know what each has done, and each share in the learning
of all; for as iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpens the face of his
friend.&nbsp; I have nothing to say against debating societies: perhaps
it was my own fault that whenever I belonged to one as a young man,
I found them inclined to make me conceited, dictatorial, hasty in my
judgments, trying to state a case before I had investigated it, to teach
others before I had taught myself, to make a fine speech, not to find
out the truth; till in, I think, a wise moment for me, I vowed at twenty
never to set foot in one again, and kept my vow.&nbsp; Be that as it
may, I wish that side by side with the debating society, I could see
young men joining in natural history societies; going out in company
on pleasant evenings to search together after the hidden treasures of
God&rsquo;s world, and read the great green book which lies open alike
to peasant and to peer; and then meeting, say once a week, to debate,
not of opinions but of facts; to show each what they had found, to classify
and explain, to learn and to wonder together.&nbsp; In such a class
many appliances would be possible.&nbsp; A microscope, for instance,
or chemical apparatus, might belong to the society, which each individual
by himself would not be able to afford; while as for books&mdash;books
on these subjects are now published at a marvellous cheapness, which
puts them within the reach of every one, and of an excellence which
twenty years ago was impossible.&nbsp; Any working man in this town
might now, especially in a class, consult scientific books, for which
I, as a lad, twenty years ago, was sighing in vain; nay, many of which,
twenty years ago, the richest nobleman could not have purchased; for
the simple reason, that, dear or cheap, they did not exist.&nbsp; Such
classes, too, would be the easiest, cheapest, and pleasantest way of
establishing what ought to exist, I think, in connection with every
institution like this, namely, a museum.&nbsp; If the young men were
really ready and willing to collect objects of interest, I doubt not
that public-spirited men would be found, who would undertake the expense
of mounting them in a museum.&nbsp; And you cannot imagine, I assure
you, how large and how interesting a museum might be formed of the natural
curiosities of a neighbourhood like this, I may say, indeed, of any
neighbourhood or of any parish: but your museum need not be confined
to the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Societies now exist in every part of England,
who will be happy to exchange their duplicates for yours.&nbsp; As your
collection increased in importance, old members abroad would gladly
contribute foreign curiosities to your stock.&nbsp; Neighbouring gentlemen
would send you valuable objects which had been lumbering their houses,
uncared for, because they stood alone, and formed no part of a collection;
and I, for one, would be happy to add something from the fauna and flora
of those moorlands, where I have so long enjoyed the wonders of nature;
never, I can honestly say, alone; because when man was not with me,
I had companions in every bee, and flower, and pebble; and never idle,
because I could not pass a swamp, or a tuft of heather, without finding
in it a fairy tale of which I could but decipher here and there a line
or two, and yet found them more interesting than all the books, save
one, which were ever written upon earth.</p>

<h2>THE NATURAL THEOLOGY OF THE FUTURE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Read at Sion College, January 10th, 1871.</p>
<p>When I accepted the unexpected and undeserved honour of being allowed
to lecture here, the first subject which suggested itself to me was
Natural Theology.</p>
<p>It is one which has taken up much of my thought for some years past,
<a name="citation313"></a><a href="#footnote313">{313}</a> which seems
to me more and more important, and which is just now somewhat forgotten;
I therefore determined to say a few words on it to-night.&nbsp; I do
not pretend to teach but only to suggest; to point out certain problems
of Natural Theology, the further solution of which ought, I think, to
be soon attempted.</p>
<p>I wish to speak, remember, not on natural religion, but on natural
theology.&nbsp; By the first, I understand what can be learned from
the physical universe of man&rsquo;s duty to God and to his neighbour;
by the latter, I understand what can be learned concerning God Himself.&nbsp;
Of natural religion I shall say nothing.&nbsp; I do not even affirm
that a natural religion is possible: but I do very earnestly believe
that a natural theology is possible; and I earnestly believe also that
it is most important that natural theology should, in every age, keep
pace with doctrinal or ecclesiastical theology.</p>
<p>Bishop Butler certainly held this belief.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Analogy
of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of
Nature&rdquo;&mdash;a book for which I entertain the most profound respect&mdash;is
based on a belief that the God of Nature and the God of Grace are one;
and that, therefore, the God who satisfies our conscience ought more
or less to satisfy our reason also.&nbsp; To teach that was Butler&rsquo;s
mission, and he fulfilled it well.&nbsp; But it is a mission which has
to be re-filled again and again, as human thought changes and human
science develops; for if in any age or country the God who seems to
be revealed by Nature seems different from the God who is revealed by
the then popular religion, then that God, and the religion which tells
of that God, will gradually cease to be believed in.</p>
<p>For the demands of Reason (as none knew better than good Bishop Butler)
must be and ought to be satisfied.&nbsp; And when a popular war arises
between the reason of a generation and its theology, it behoves the
ministers of religion to inquire, with all humility and godly fear,
on which side lies the fault: whether the theology which they expound
is all that it should be, or whether the reason of those who impugn
it is all that it should be.</p>
<p>For me, as (I trust) an orthodox priest of the Church of England,
I believe the theology of the National Church of England, as by law
established, to be eminently rational as well as scriptural.&nbsp; It
is not, therefore, surprising to me that the clergy of the Church of
England, since the foundation of the Royal Society in the seventeenth
century, have done more for sound physical science than the clergy of
any other denomination; or that the three greatest natural theologians
with which I, at least, am acquainted&mdash;Berkeley, Butler, and Paley&mdash;should
have belonged to our Church.&nbsp; I am not unaware of what the Germans
of the eighteenth century have done.&nbsp; I consider Goethe&rsquo;s
claims to have advanced natural theology very much over-rated: but I
do recommend to young clergymen Herder&rsquo;s &ldquo;Outlines of the
Philosophy of the History of Man&rdquo; as a book (in spite of certain
defects) full of sound and precious wisdom.&nbsp; But it seems to me
that English natural theology in the eighteenth century stood more secure
than that of any other nation, on the foundation which Berkeley, Butler,
and Paley had laid; and that if our orthodox thinkers for the last hundred
years had followed steadily in their steps, we should not be deploring
now a wide, and as some think increasing, divorce between Science and
Christianity.</p>
<p>But it was not so to be.&nbsp; The impulse given by Wesley and Whitfield
turned (and not before it was needed) the earnest mind of England almost
exclusively to questions of personal religion; and that impulse, under
many unexpected forms, has continued ever since.&nbsp; I only state
the fact&mdash;I do not deplore it; God forbid!&nbsp; Wisdom is justified
of all her children, and as, according to the wise American, &ldquo;it
takes all sorts to make a world,&rdquo; so it takes all sorts to make
a living Church.&nbsp; But that the religious temper of England for
the last two or three generations has been unfavourable to a sound and
scientific development of natural theology, there can be no doubt.</p>
<p>We have only, if we need proof, to look at the hymns&mdash;many of
them very pure, pious, and beautiful&mdash;which are used at this day
in churches and chapels by persons of every shade of opinion.&nbsp;
How often is the tone in which they speak of the natural world one of
dissatisfaction, distrust, almost contempt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Disease, decay,
and death around I see,&rdquo; is their key-note, rather than &ldquo;O
all ye works of the Lord, bless Him, praise Him, and magnify Him together.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There lingers about them a savour of the old monastic theory, that this
earth is the devil&rsquo;s planet, fallen, accursed, goblin-haunted,
needing to be exorcised at every turn before it is useful or even safe
for man.&nbsp; An age which has adopted as its most popular hymn a paraphrase
of the medi&aelig;val monk&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hic breve vivitur,&rdquo;
and in which stalwart public-school boys are bidden in their chapel
worship to tell the Almighty God of Truth that they lie awake weeping
at night for joy at the thought that they will die and see Jerusalem
the Golden&mdash;is doubtless, a pious and devout age; but not&mdash;at
least as yet&mdash;an age in which natural theology is likely to attain
a high, a healthy, or a scriptural development.</p>
<p>Not a scriptural development.&nbsp; Let me press on you, my clerical
brethren, most earnestly this one point.&nbsp; It is time that we should
make up our minds what tone Scripture does take toward Nature, natural
science, natural theology.&nbsp; Most of you, I doubt not, have made
up your minds already, and in consequence have no fear of natural science,
no fear for natural theology.&nbsp; But I cannot deny that I find still
lingering here and there certain of the old views of nature of which
I used to hear but too much here in London some five-and-thirty years
ago; not from my own father, thank God! for he, to his honour, was one
of those few London clergy who then faced and defended advanced physical
science; but from others&mdash;better men too than I shall ever hope
to be&mdash;who used to consider natural theology as useless, fallacious,
impossible, on the ground that this Earth did not reveal the will and
character of God, because it was cursed and fallen; and that its facts,
in consequence, were not to be respected or relied on.&nbsp; This, I
was told, was the doctrine of Scripture, and was therefore true.&nbsp;
But when, longing to reconcile my conscience and my reason on a question
so awful to a young student of natural science, I went to my Bible,
what did I find?&nbsp; No word of all this.&nbsp; Much&mdash;thank God,
I may say one continuous undercurrent&mdash;of the very opposite of
all this.&nbsp; I pray you bear with me, even though I may seem impertinent.&nbsp;
But what do we find in the Bible, with the exception of that first curse?&nbsp;
That, remember, cannot mean any alteration in the laws of nature by
which man&rsquo;s labour should only produce for him henceforth thorns
and thistles.&nbsp; For, in the first place, any such curse is formally
abrogated in the eighth chapter and twenty-first verse of the very same
document&mdash;&ldquo;I will not again curse the earth any more for
man&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest,
cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall not cease.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And next, the fact is not so; for if you root up the thorns and thistles,
and keep your land clean, then assuredly you will grow fruit-trees and
not thorns, wheat and not thistles, according to those laws of Nature
which are the voice of God expressed in facts.</p>
<p>And yet the words are true.&nbsp; There is a curse upon the earth,
though not one which, by altering the laws of nature, has made natural
facts untrustworthy.&nbsp; There is a curse on the earth; such a curse
as is expressed, I believe, in the old Hebrew text, where the word &ldquo;adamah&rdquo;
(correctly translated in our version &ldquo;the ground&rdquo;) signifies,
as I am told, not this planet; but simply the soil from whence we get
our food; such a curse as certainly is expressed by the Septuagint and
the Vulgate versions: &ldquo;Cursed is the earth&rdquo;&mdash; &epsilon;&nu;
&tau;&omicron;&iota;&sigmaf; &epsilon;&rho;y&omicron;&iota;&sigmaf;
&sigma;&omicron;&upsilon;; &ldquo;in opere tuo,&rdquo; as the Vulgate
has it&mdash;&ldquo;in thy works.&rdquo;&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s work is too
often the curse of the very planet which he misuses.&nbsp; None should
know that better than the botanist, who sees whole regions desolate,
and given up to sterility and literal thorns and thistles, on account
of man&rsquo;s sin and folly, ignorance and greedy waste.&nbsp; Well
said that veteran botanist, the venerable Elias Fries, of Lund:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A broad band of waste land follows gradually in the steps
of cultivation.&nbsp; If it expands, its centre and its cradle dies,
and on the outer borders only do we find green shoots.&nbsp; But it
is not impossible, only difficult, for man, without renouncing the advantage
of culture itself, one day to make reparation for the injury which he
has inflicted: he is appointed lord of creation.&nbsp; True it is that
thorns and thistles, ill-favoured and poisonous plants, well named by
botanists rubbish plants, mark the track which man has proudly traversed
through the earth.&nbsp; Before him lay original Nature in her wild
but sublime beauty.&nbsp; Behind him he leaves the desert, a deformed
and ruined land; for childish desire of destruction, or thoughtless
squandering of vegetable treasures, has destroyed the character of nature;
and, terrified, man himself flies from the arena of his actions, leaving
the impoverished earth to barbarous races or to animals, so long as
yet another spot in virgin beauty smiles before him.&nbsp; Here again,
in selfish pursuit of profit, and consciously or unconsciously following
the abominable principle of the great moral vileness which one man has
expressed&mdash;&lsquo;Apr&egrave;s nous le D&eacute;luge&rsquo;&mdash;he
begins anew the work of destruction.&nbsp; Thus did cultivation, driven
out, leave the East, and perhaps the deserts formerly robbed of their
coverings; like the wild hordes of old over beautiful Greece, thus rolls
this conquest with fearful rapidity from East to West through America;
and the planter now often leaves the already exhausted land, and the
eastern climate, become infertile through the demolition of the forests,
to introduce a similar revolution into the Far West.&rdquo; <a name="citation320"></a><a href="#footnote320">{320}</a></p>
<p>As we proceed, we find nothing in the general tone of Scripture which
can hinder our natural theology being at once scriptural and scientific.</p>
<p>If it is to be scientific, it must begin by approaching Nature at
once with a cheerful and reverent spirit, as a noble, healthy, and trustworthy
thing: and what is that, save the spirit of those who wrote the 104th,
147th, and 148th Psalms&mdash;the spirit, too, of him who wrote that
Song of the Three Children, which is, as it were, the flower and crown
of the Old Testament, the summing up of all that is most true and eternal
in the old Jewish faith; and which, as long as it is sung in our churches,
is the charter and title-deed of all Christian students of those works
of the Lord, which it calls on to bless Him, praise Him, and magnify
Him for ever?</p>
<p>What next will be demanded of us by physical science?&nbsp; Belief,
certainly, just now, in the permanence of natural laws.&nbsp; Why, that
is taken for granted, I hold, throughout the Bible.&nbsp; I cannot see
how our Lord&rsquo;s parables, drawn from the birds and the flowers,
the seasons and the weather, have any logical weight, or can be considered
as aught but capricious and fanciful illustrations&mdash;which God forbid&mdash;unless
we look at them as instances of laws of the natural world, which find
their analogues in the laws of the spiritual world, the kingdom of God.&nbsp;
I cannot conceive a man&rsquo;s writing that 104th Psalm who had not
the most deep, the most earnest sense of the permanence of natural law.&nbsp;
But more: the fact is expressly asserted again and again.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
continue this day according to Thine ordinance, for all things serve
Thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou hast made them fast for ever and ever.&nbsp;
Thou hast given them a law which shall not be broken&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us pass on, gentlemen.&nbsp; There is no more to be said about
this matter.</p>
<p>But next, it will be demanded of us that natural theology shall set
forth a God whose character is consistent with all the facts of nature,
and not only with those which are pleasant and beautiful.&nbsp; That
challenge was accepted, and I think victoriously, by Bishop Butler as
far as the Christian religion is concerned.&nbsp; As far as the Scripture
is concerned, we may answer thus:</p>
<p>It is said to us&mdash;I know that it is said: You tell us of a God
of love, a God of flowers and sunshine, of singing birds and little
children.&nbsp; But there are more facts in nature than these.&nbsp;
There is premature death, pestilence, famine.&nbsp; And if you answer:
Man has control over these; they are caused by man&rsquo;s ignorance
and sin, and by his breaking of natural laws&mdash;what will you make
of those destructive powers over which he has no control; of the hurricane
and the earthquake; of poisons, vegetable and mineral; of those parasitic
Entozoa whose awful abundance, and awful destructiveness in man and
beast, science is just revealing&mdash;a new page of danger and loathsomeness?&nbsp;
How does that suit your conception of a God of love?</p>
<p>We can answer: Whether or not it suits our conception of a God of
love, it suits Scripture&rsquo;s conception of Him.&nbsp; For nothing
is more clear&mdash;nay, is it not urged again and again, as a blot
on Scripture?&mdash;that it reveals a God not merely of love, but of
sternness&mdash;a God in whose eyes physical pain is not the worst of
evils, nor animal life (too often miscalled human life) the most precious
of objects&mdash;a God who destroys, when it seems fit to Him, and that
wholesale, and seemingly without either pity or discrimination, man,
woman and child, visiting the sins of the fathers on the children, making
the land empty and bare, and destroying from off it man and beast!&nbsp;
This is the God of the Old Testament.&nbsp; And if any say (as is often
too rashly said): This is not the God of the New: I answer, but have
you read your New Testament?&nbsp; Have you read the latter chapters
of St. Matthew?&nbsp; Have you read the opening of the Epistle to the
Romans?&nbsp; Have you read the Book of Revelations?&nbsp; If so, will
you say that the God of the New Testament is, compared with the God
of the Old, less awful, less destructive, and therefore less like the
Being&mdash;granting always that there is such a Being&mdash;who presides
over nature and her destructive powers?&nbsp; It is an awful problem.&nbsp;
But the writers of the Bible have faced it valiantly.&nbsp; Physical
science is facing it valiantly now.&nbsp; Therefore natural theology
may face it likewise.&nbsp; Remember Carlyle&rsquo;s great words about
poor Francesca in the Inferno: &ldquo;Infinite pity, yet also infinite
rigour of law.&nbsp; It is so Nature is made.&nbsp; It is so Dante discerned
that she was made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are two other points on which I must beg leave to say a few
words.&nbsp; Physical science will demand of our natural theologians
that they should be aware of their importance, and let (as Mr. Matthew
Arnold would say) their thoughts play freely round them.&nbsp; I mean
questions of Embryology and questions of Race.</p>
<p>On the first there may be much to be said, which is for the present
best left unsaid, even here.&nbsp; I only ask you to recollect how often
in Scripture those two plain old words, beget and bring forth, occur,
and in what important passages.&nbsp; And I ask you to remember that
marvellous essay on Natural Theology, if I may so call it in all reverence,
the 139th Psalm, and judge for yourself whether he who wrote that did
not consider the study of Embryology as important, as significant, as
worthy of his deepest attention, as an Owen, a Huxley, or a Darwin.&nbsp;
Nay, I will go farther still, and say, that in those great words&mdash;&ldquo;Thine
eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; and in Thy book all
my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as
yet there was none of them,&rdquo;&mdash;in those words, I say, the
Psalmist has anticipated that realistic view of embryological questions
to which our most modern philosophers are, it seems to me, slowly, half
unconsciously, but still inevitably, returning.</p>
<p>Next, as to Race.&nbsp; Some persons now have a nervous fear of that
word, and of allowing any importance to difference of races.&nbsp; Some
dislike it, because they think that it endangers the modern notions
of democratic equality.&nbsp; Others because they fear that it may be
proved that the negro is not a man and a brother.&nbsp; I think the
fears of both parties groundless.&nbsp; As for the negro, I not only
believe him to be of the same race as myself, but that&mdash;if Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s theories are true&mdash;science has proved that he must
be such.&nbsp; I should have thought, as a humble student of such questions,
that the one fact of the unique distribution of the hair in all races
of human beings, was full moral proof that they had all had one common
ancestor.&nbsp; But this is not matter of natural theology.&nbsp; What
is matter thereof, is this:</p>
<p>Physical science is proving more and more the immense importance
of Race; the importance of hereditary powers, hereditary organs, hereditary
habits, in all organised beings, from the lowest plant to the highest
animal.&nbsp; She is proving more and more the omnipresent action of
the differences between races; how the more favoured race (she cannot
avoid using the epithet) exterminates the less favoured, or at least
expels it, and forces it, under penalty of death, to adapt itself to
new circumstances; and, in a word, that competition between every race
and every individual of that race, and reward according to deserts,
is (as far as we can see) an universal law of living things.&nbsp; And
she says&mdash;for the facts of history prove it&mdash;that as it is
among the races of plants and animals, so it has been unto this day
among the races of men.</p>
<p>The natural theology of the future must take count of these tremendous
and even painful facts: and she may take count of them.&nbsp; For Scripture
has taken count of them already.&nbsp; It talks continually&mdash;it
has been blamed for talking so much&mdash;of races, of families; of
their wars, their struggles, their exterminations; of races favoured,
of races rejected, of remnants being saved to continue the race; of
hereditary tendencies, hereditary excellences, hereditary guilt.&nbsp;
Its sense of the reality and importance of descent is so intense, that
it speaks of a whole tribe or a whole family by the name of its common
ancestor, and the whole nation of the Jews is Israel, to the end.&nbsp;
And if I be told this is true of the Old Testament, but not of the New,
I must answer: What! does not St. Paul hold the identity of the whole
Jewish race with Israel their forefather, as strongly as any prophet
of the Old Testament?&nbsp; And what is the central historic fact, save
One, of the New Testament, but the conquest of Jerusalem&mdash;the dispersion,
all but destruction of a race, not by miracle, but by invasion, because
found wanting when weighed in the stern balances of natural and social
law?</p>
<p>Gentlemen, think of this.&nbsp; I only suggest the thought; but I
do not suggest it in haste.&nbsp; Think over it&mdash;by the light which
our Lord&rsquo;s parables, His analogies between the physical and social
constitution of the world, afford&mdash;and consider whether those awful
words, fulfilled then and fulfilled so often since&mdash;&ldquo;The
kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing
forth the fruits hereof&rdquo;&mdash;may not be the supreme instance,
the most complex development of a law which runs through all created
things, down to the moss which struggles for existence on the rock!</p>
<p>Do I say that this is all?&nbsp; That man is merely a part of Nature,
the puppet of circumstances and hereditary tendencies?&nbsp; That brute
competition is the one law of his life?&nbsp; That he is doomed for
ever to be the slave of his own needs, enforced by an internecine struggle
for existence?&nbsp; God forbid.&nbsp; I believe not only in Nature,
but in Grace.&nbsp; I believe that this is man&rsquo;s fate only as
long as he sows to the flesh, and of the flesh reaps corruption.&nbsp;
I believe that if he will</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>Strive upward, working out the beast,<br />And let the ape and tiger
die;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>if he will be even as wise as the social animals; as the ant and
the bee, who have risen, if not to the virtue of all-embracing charity,
at least to the virtues of self-sacrifice and patriotism, <a name="citation326"></a><a href="#footnote326">{326}</a>
then he will rise towards a higher sphere; toward that kingdom of God
of which it is written: &ldquo;He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in
God, and God in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether that be matter of natural theology, I cannot tell as yet.&nbsp;
But as for all the former questions&mdash;all that St. Paul means when
he talks of the law, and how the works of the flesh bring men under
the law, stern and terrible and destructive, though holy and just and
good,&mdash;they are matter of natural theology; and I believe that
on them, as elsewhere, Scripture and science will be ultimately found
to coincide.</p>
<p>But here we have to face an objection which you will often hear now
from scientific men, and still oftener from non-scientific men; who
will say: It matters not to us whether Scripture contradicts or does
not contradict a scientific natural theology; for we hold such a science
to be impossible and naught.&nbsp; The old Jews put a God into Nature,
and therefore of course they could see, as you see, what they had already
put there.&nbsp; But we see no God in Nature.&nbsp; We do not deny the
existence of a God; we merely say that scientific research does not
reveal Him to us.&nbsp; We see no marks of design in physical phenomena.&nbsp;
What used to be considered as marks of design can be better explained
by considering them as the results of evolution according to necessary
laws; and you and Scripture make a mere assumption when you ascribe
them to the operation of a mind like the human mind.</p>
<p>Now, on this point I believe we may answer fearlessly: If you cannot
see it we cannot help you.&nbsp; If the heavens do not declare to you
the glory of God, nor the firmament show you His handy-work, then our
poor arguments about them will not show it.&nbsp; &ldquo;The eye can
only see that which it brings with it the power of seeing.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We can only reassert that we see design everywhere, and that the vast
majority of the human race in every age and clime has seen it.&nbsp;
Analogy from experience, sound induction (as we hold) from the works
not only of men but of animals, has made it an all but self-evident
truth to us, that wherever there is arrangement, there must be an arranger;
wherever there is adaptation of means to an end, there must be an adapter;
wherever an organisation, there must be an organiser.&nbsp; The existence
of a designing God is no more demonstrable from Nature than the existence
of other human beings independent of ourselves, or, indeed, the existence
of our own bodies.&nbsp; But, like the belief in them, the belief in
Him has become an article of our common sense.&nbsp; And that this designing
mind is, in some respects, similar to the human mind, is proved to us
(as Sir John Herschel well puts it) by the mere fact that we can discover
and comprehend the processes of Nature.</p>
<p>But here again, if we be contradicted, we can only reassert.&nbsp;
If the old words, &ldquo;He that made the eye, shall He not see?&nbsp;
He that planted the ear, shall He not hear?&rdquo; do not at once commend
themselves to the intellect of any person, we shall never convince that
person by any arguments drawn from the absurdity of conceiving the invention
of optics by a blind race, or of music by a deaf one.</p>
<p>So we will assert our own old-fashioned notion boldly; and more:
we will say, in spite of ridicule, that if such a God exists, final
causes must exist also.&nbsp; That the whole universe must be one chain
of final causes.&nbsp; That if there be a Supreme Reason, He must have
a reason, and that a good reason, for every physical phenomenon.</p>
<p>We will tell the modern scientific man&mdash;You are nervously afraid
of the mention of final causes.&nbsp; You quote against them Bacon&rsquo;s
saying, that they are barren virgins; that no physical fact was ever
discovered or explained by them.&nbsp; You are right as far as regards
yourselves; you have no business with final causes, because final causes
are moral causes, and you are physical students only.&nbsp; We, the
natural theologians, have business with them.&nbsp; Your duty is to
find out the How of things; ours, to find out the Why.&nbsp; If you
rejoin that we shall never find out the Why, unless we first learn something
of the How, we shall not deny that.&nbsp; It may be most useful, I had
almost said necessary, that the clergy should have some scientific training.&nbsp;
It may be most useful, I sometimes dream of a day when it will be considered
necessary, that every candidate for ordination should be required to
have passed creditably in at least one branch of physical science, if
it be only to teach him the method of sound scientific thought.&nbsp;
But our having learnt the How, will not make it needless, much less
impossible, for us to study the Why.&nbsp; It will merely make more
clear to us the things of which we have to study the Why; and enable
us to keep the How and the Why more religiously apart from each other.</p>
<p>But if it be said: After all, there is no Why; the doctrine of evolution,
by doing away with the theory of creation, does away with that of final
causes&mdash;let us answer, boldly: Not in the least.&nbsp; We might
accept all that Mr. Darwin, all that Professor Huxley, has so learnedly
and so acutely written on physical science, and yet preserve our natural
theology on exactly the same basis as that on which Butler and Paley
left it.&nbsp; That we should have to develop it, I do not deny.&nbsp;
That we should have to relinquish it, I do.</p>
<p>Let me press this thought earnestly on you.&nbsp; I know that many
wiser and better men than I have fears on this point.&nbsp; I cannot
share in them.</p>
<p>All, it seems to me, that the new doctrines of Evolution demand is
this.&nbsp; We all agree, for the fact is patent, that our own bodies,
and indeed the body of every living creature, are evolved from a seemingly
simple germ by natural laws, without visible action of any designing
will or mind, into the full organisation of a human or other creature.&nbsp;
Yet we do not say, on that account: God did not create me; I only grew.&nbsp;
We hold in this case to our old idea, and say: If there be evolution,
there must be an evolver.&nbsp; Now the new physical theories only ask
us, it seems to me, to extend this conception to the whole universe:
to believe that not individuals merely, but whole varieties and races,
the total organised life on this planet, and it may be the total organisation
of the universe, have been evolved just as our bodies are, by natural
laws acting through circumstance.&nbsp; This may be true, or may be
false.&nbsp; But all its truth can do to the natural theologian will
be to make him believe that the Creator bears the same relation to the
whole universe as that Creator undeniably bears to every individual
human body.</p>
<p>I entreat you to weigh these words, which have not been written in
haste; and I entreat you also, if you wish to see how little the new
theory, that species may have been gradually created by variation, natural
selection, and so forth, interferes with the old theory of design, contrivance,
and adaptation, nay, with the fullest admission of benevolent final
causes&mdash;I entreat you, I say, to study Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fertilisation
of Orchids&rdquo;&mdash;a book which (whether his main theory be true
or not) will still remain a most valuable addition to natural theology.</p>
<p>For suppose, gentlemen, that all the species of Orchids, and not
only they, but their congeners&mdash;the Gingers, the Arrowroots, the
Bananas&mdash;are all the descendants of one original form, which was
most probably nearly allied to the Snowdrop and the Iris.&nbsp; What
then?&nbsp; Would that be one whit more wonderful, more unworthy of
the wisdom and power of God, than if they were, as most believe, created
each and all at once, with their minute and often imaginary shades of
difference?&nbsp; What would the natural theologian have to say, were
the first theory true, save that God&rsquo;s works are even more wonderful
than he always believed them to be?&nbsp; As for the theory being impossible:
we must leave the discussion of that to physical students.&nbsp; It
is not for us clergymen to limit the power of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is anything
too hard for the Lord?&rdquo; asked the prophet of old: and we have
a right to ask it as long as time shall last.&nbsp; If it be said that
natural selection is too simple a cause to produce such fantastic variety:
that, again, is a question to be settled exclusively by physical students.&nbsp;
All we have to say on the matter is, that we always knew that God works
by very simple, or seemingly simple, means; that the whole universe,
as far as we could discern it, was one concatenation of the most simple
means; that it was wonderful, yea, miraculous in our eyes, that a child
should resemble its parents, that the raindrops should make the grass
grow, that the grass should become flesh, and the flesh sustenance for
the thinking brain of man.&nbsp; Ought God to seem less or more august
in our eyes, when we are told that His means are even more simple than
we supposed?&nbsp; We held Him to be Almighty and Allwise.&nbsp; Are
we to reverence Him less or more, if we hear that His might is greater,
His wisdom deeper, than we ever dreamed?&nbsp; We believed that His
care was over all His works; that His Providence watched perpetually
over the whole universe.&nbsp; We were taught&mdash;some of us at least&mdash;by
Holy Scripture, to believe that the whole history of the universe was
made up of special Providences.&nbsp; If, then, that should be true
which Mr. Darwin writes: &ldquo;It may be metaphorically said that natural
selection is daily and hourly scrutinising throughout the world, every
variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving
and adding up that which is good, silently and incessantly working whenever
and wherever opportunity offers at the improvement of every organic
being&rdquo;&mdash;if that, I say, were proven to be true, ought God&rsquo;s
care and God&rsquo;s providence to seem less or more magnificent in
our eyes?&nbsp; Of old it was said by Him without whom nothing is made:
&ldquo;My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shall we
quarrel with Science if she should show how those words are true?&nbsp;
What, in one word, should we have to say but this?&mdash;We knew of
old that God was so wise that He could make all things; but behold,
He is so much wiser than even that, that He can make all things make
themselves.</p>
<p>But it may be said: These notions are contrary to Scripture.&nbsp;
I must beg very humbly, but very firmly, to demur to that opinion.&nbsp;
Scripture says that God created.&nbsp; But it nowhere defines that term.&nbsp;
The means, the How of Creation, is nowhere specified.&nbsp; Scripture,
again, says that organised beings were produced each according to their
kind.&nbsp; But it nowhere defines that term.&nbsp; What a kind includes,
whether it includes or not the capacity of varying (which is just the
question in point), is nowhere specified.&nbsp; And I think it a most
important rule in scriptural exegesis, to be most cautious as to limiting
the meaning of any term which Scripture itself has not limited, lest
we find ourselves putting into the teaching of Scripture our own human
theories or prejudices.&nbsp; And consider, Is not man a kind?&nbsp;
And has not mankind varied, physically, intellectually, spiritually?&nbsp;
Is not the Bible, from beginning to end, a history of the variations
of mankind, for worse or for better, from their original type?</p>
<p>Let us rather look with calmness, and even with hope and good will,
on these new theories; for, correct or incorrect, they surely mark a
tendency toward a more, not a less, scriptural view of nature.&nbsp;
Are they not attempts, whether successful or unsuccessful, to escape
from that shallow mechanical notion of the universe and its Creator
which was too much in vogue in the eighteenth century among divines
as well as philosophers; the theory which Goethe (to do him justice),
and after him Mr. Thomas Carlyle, have treated with such noble scorn;
the theory, I mean, that God has wound up the universe like a clock,
and left it to tick by itself till it runs down, never troubling Himself
with it, save possibly&mdash;for even that was only half believed&mdash;by
rare miraculous interferences with the laws which He Himself had made?&nbsp;
Out of that chilling dream of a dead universe ungoverned by an absent
God, the human mind, in Germany especially, tried during the early part
of this century to escape by strange roads; roads by which there was
no escape, because they were not laid down on the firm ground of scientific
facts.&nbsp; Then, in despair, men turned to the facts which they had
neglected, and said: We are weary of philosophy; we will study you,
and you alone.&nbsp; As for God, who can find Him?&nbsp; And they have
worked at the facts like gallant and honest men; and their work, like
all good work, has produced, in the last fifty years, results more enormous
than they even dreamed.&nbsp; But what are they finding, more and more,
below their facts, below all phenomena which the scalpel and the microscope
can show?&nbsp; A something nameless, invisible, imponderable, yet seemingly
omnipresent and omnipotent, retreating before them deeper and deeper,
the deeper they delve: namely, the life which shapes and makes&mdash;that
which the old school-men called &ldquo;forma formativa,&rdquo; which
they call vital force and what not&mdash;metaphors all, or rather counters
to mark an unknown quantity, as if they should call it <i>x</i> or <i>y</i>.&nbsp;
One says: It is all vibrations; but his reason, unsatisfied, asks: And
what makes the vibrations vibrate?&nbsp; Another: It is all physiological
units; but his reason asks: What is the &ldquo;physis,&rdquo; the nature
and &ldquo;innate tendency&rdquo; of the units?&nbsp; A third: It may
be all caused by infinitely numerous &ldquo;gemmules;&rdquo; but his
reason asks him: What puts infinite order into those gemmules, instead
of infinite anarchy?&nbsp; I mention these theories not to laugh at
them.&nbsp; No man has a deeper respect for those who have put them
forth.&nbsp; Nor would it interfere with my theological creed, if any
or all of them were proven to be true to-morrow.&nbsp; I mention them
only to show that beneath all these theories&mdash;true or false&mdash;still
lies the unknown <i>x</i>.&nbsp; Scientific men are becoming more and
more aware of it; I had almost said ready to worship it.&nbsp; More
and more the noblest-minded of them are engrossed by the mystery of
that unknown and truly miraculous element in Nature, which is always
escaping them, though they cannot escape it.&nbsp; How should they escape
it?&nbsp; Was it not written of old: &ldquo;Whither shall I go from
Thy presence, or whither shall I flee from Thy spirit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah that we clergy would summon up courage to tell them that!&nbsp;
Courage to tell them&mdash;what need not hamper for a moment the freedom
of their investigations, what will add to them a sanction, I may say
a sanctity&mdash;that the unknown <i>x</i> which lies below all phenomena,
which is for ever at work on all phenomena, on the whole and on every
part of the whole, down to the colouring of every leaf and the curdling
of every cell of protoplasm, is none other than that which the old Hebrews
called&mdash;(by a metaphor, no doubt&mdash;for how can man speak of
the unseen, save in metaphors drawn from the seen?&mdash;but by the
only metaphor adequate to express the perpetual and omnipresent miracle)&mdash;The
Breath of God; The Spirit who is The Lord and Giver of Life.</p>
<p>In the rest, gentlemen, let us think, and let us observe.&nbsp; For
if we are ignorant, not merely of the results of experimental science,
but of the methods thereof, then we and the men of science shall have
no common ground whereon to stretch out kindly hands to each other.</p>
<p>But let us have patience and faith; and not suppose in haste, that
when those hands are stretched out it will be needful for us to leave
our standing-ground, or to cast ourselves down from the pinnacle of
the temple to earn popularity; above all, from earnest students who
are too high-minded to care for popularity themselves.</p>
<p>True, if we have an intelligent belief in those Creeds and those
Scriptures which are committed to our keeping, then our philosophy cannot
be that which is just now in vogue.&nbsp; But all we have to do, I believe,
is to wait.&nbsp; Nominalism, and that &ldquo;Sensationalism&rdquo;
which has sprung from nominalism, are running fast to seed; Comtism
seems to me its supreme effort: after which the whirligig of Time may
bring round its revenges; and Realism, and we who own the Realist creeds,
may have our turn.&nbsp; Only wait.&nbsp; When a grave, able, and authoritative
philosopher explains a mother&rsquo;s love of her newborn babe, as Professor
Bain has done, in a really eloquent passage of his book on the &ldquo;Emotions
and the Will&rdquo; (Second Edition, pp. 78, 79), then the end of that
philosophy is very near; and an older, simpler, more human, and, as
I hold, more philosophic explanation of that natural phenomenon, and
of all others, may get a hearing.</p>
<p>Only wait; and fret not yourselves, else shall you be moved to do
evil.&nbsp; Remember the saying of the wise man: &ldquo;Go not after
the world.&nbsp; She turns on her axis; and if thou stand still long
enough she will turn round to thee.&rdquo;</p>

Novalis, I think, says that one&rsquo;s own thought gains quite infinitely
in value as soon as one finds it shared by even one other human being.&nbsp;
The saying has proved true, at least, to me.&nbsp; The morning after
this paper was read, I received a book, &ldquo;The Genesis of Species,
by St. George Mivart, F.R.S.&rdquo;&nbsp; The name of the author demanded
all attention and respect; and as I read on, I found him, to my exceeding
pleasure, advocating views which I had long held, with a learning and
ability to which I have no pretensions.&nbsp; The book will, doubtless,
excite much useful criticism and discussion in the scientific world.&nbsp;
I hope that it may do the same in the clerical world; and I earnestly
beg those clergymen who heard me with so much patience and courtesy
at Sion College, to ponder well Mr. Mivart&rsquo;s last chapter, on
&ldquo;Theology and Evolution.&rdquo;</p>

I am well aware what a serious question is opened up in these words.&nbsp;
The fact that the great majority of workers among the social insects
are barren females or nuns, devoting themselves to the care of other
individuals&rsquo; offspring, by an act of self-sacrifice, and that
by means of that self-sacrifice these communities grow large and prosperous,
ought to be well weighed just now; both by those who hold that morality
has been evolved from perceptions of what was useful or pleasurable,
and by those who hold as I do that morality is one, immutable and eternal.&nbsp;
Those who take the former view (confounding, as Mr. Mivart well points
out in his Genesis of Species, &ldquo;material&rdquo; and &ldquo;formal&rdquo;
morality) have no difficulty in tracing the germs of the highest human
morality in animals; for self-interest is, in their eyes, the ultimate
ground of morality, and the average animal is utterly selfish.&nbsp;
But certain animals perform acts, as in the case of working bees and
ants, and (as I hold) in the case of mothers working for and protecting
their offspring, which at least seem formally moral; because they seem
founded on self-sacrifice.&nbsp; I am well aware, I say again, of the
very serious admissions which we clergymen should have to make if we
confessed that these acts really are that which they seem to be.&nbsp;
But I do not see why we should not be as just to an ant as to a human
being; I am ready, with Socrates, to follow the Logos whithersoever
it leads; and I hope that Mr. Mivart will reconsider the two latter
paragraphs of p. 196, and let his &ldquo;thoughts play freely&rdquo;
round this curious subject.&nbsp; Perhaps, in so doing, he may lay his
hand on an even sharper weapon than those which he has already used
against the sensationalist theory of morals.</p>

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at
http://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
